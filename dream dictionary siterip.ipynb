You may have the sense that changes need to happen - but are afraid to allow any type of 'inner shifting' to occur. When you dream of an earthquake - the dream is bringing about this foundational change. Unlike a landslide that shows an inconsistency in thinking that undermines the foundation, or a flood that embodies how emotions eventually wear away at the foundation - the earthquake relates more to a tendency to block change - or a tendency to hold your ground. Dreams provide a safe environment to explore change. When you dream of an earthquake - the message is to loosen up your rigid outlook and move with the changes so that a foundation more appropriate to your needs of the present can be established.

You use them to take what you need in order to find nourishment and self worth. Like food, the symbolism is exploring fulfillment. The difference between a fork and a spoon is their shape. A spoon suggests what you need to hold onto in order to feel satisfied, while the fork is more symbolic of taking a stab at something, or making a change in direction that will help you provide for yourself. The fork can also symbolize choices or a crossroad, as in a 'fork in the road.' The knife can symbolize ideas that are painful or the cutting away of something. You may have to face the truth or eliminate outworn behavior.

Not being a part of a conversation taking place between characters can show your disinterest or how you are not owning up to something. Often what the other characters are discussing seems bizarre. It is these bizarre clues that are richest in meaning - if you really explore what is being brought to your attention in this cryptic manner - you will discover something very important about yourself that you had not acknowledged prior. People discussing food can portray your lack of fulfillment and what you might do to feel fulfilled. People discussing work can symbolize how you are not satisfied with your career - even while you ignore these feelings. People discussing a car can be helping you to recognize what it will take to move forward in a more empowered manner. If people are discussing the weather or a natural disaster - your inner foundation may be undergoing transformation that will lead to rebirth.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/echo\">Echo</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1518444667766-94728310399f?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxFY2hvfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"black Amazon echo dot speaker\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@hckmstrrahul?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Rahul Chakraborty</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Hearing an echo can be a way of revisiting something that was said.

If the landscape suddenly becomes dark because of the eclipse, you may be testing your idea of power against external powers that feel beyond your control. The onset of sudden darkness is also symbolic of recognizing how there may be issues that are still outside of your awareness. How the eclipse makes you feel becomes important in understanding the message of the dream.

Upper floors&nbsp;show the movement toward&nbsp;aspirations, while lower floors can symbolize fear, retreat&nbsp;or the subconscious attitudes that affect your ability to move ‘upward.’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">If the elevator is moving sideways or forward - the dream can have a different meaning. It can be symbolic a 'lateral' move rather than an 'upward' promotion. Expectations of a promotion may be on hold until something is accomplished or proven (something mechanical not working properly). Also, since an elevator is an automated device there can be a message about putting more 'drive' or direction into your approach. If it felt that the elevator was moving 'sideways' the messge can be about deviating or the need to deviate from a chosen path. You'd might consider how the&nbsp;elevator's behavior&nbsp;left you feeling - and how those feelings need to be explored.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The elevator 'transports' you without any sense of control and can symbolize uncertainty in your life direction. Rather than taking actual 'footsteps,' you 'hit a button' and trust that&nbsp;'fate' is leading&nbsp;you to&nbsp;your destination. Often associated with anxiety, you are forced to rely on a ‘mechanical vehicle,’ to get you where you want to go. In this way, the elevator can suggest patterns of emotions or programmed responses that influence your motivation and therefore, your ability to achieve success. Anything odd about the elevator should be examined for clues about your current approach.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The elevator can symbolize how you&nbsp;‘remain in a <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/box\"><strong>Box</strong></a>,’ where ‘doors’ open automatically, and so, the elevator can offer a message about transcending self defeating ideas. The ride can be smooth and reliable or something confusing and chaotic in proportion to how you feel you are moving toward your aspirations and whether or not you feel empowered to achieve your desires. The other symbolism&nbsp;included in&nbsp;the elevator dream&nbsp;can offer clues that can help you break through your fears to achieve success.

Dreams push you out of your comfort zone so that you can be who you are - independent of what others think of you. In new situations when you are revealing yourself to others, you may dream of being underdressed, in your underwear or going to the bathroom in front of others. Feeling like your dress isn't appropriate is the same as feeling that who you are doesn't quite 'fit in.' Evert aspect of nature is unique and human beings are no different.

Generally the prior dreams will be describing a situation you are working through and going to the emergency room is a message about seeking help. Our memories associate this symbol with the idea of a last resort or a life and death situation. This type of dream should be considered as the idea that you are not getting the message, or are not achieving the breakthrough.

When you are experiencing constant rejection, you might explore its root as your fear of intimacy.

It suggests worry that there may be no end in sight. The dreamscape offers a more holistic perspective, where one thing simply merges into something else. At the same time, the unconscious demonstrates a type of perception that also transcends your normal distinctions. The end of a road can symbolize letting go of the past, while the end of a hallway can signify the end of a transitional phase. If the end or a lack of resolution becomes a major focal point that stirs feelings of anxiety within you, perhaps you are learning to release a way of perceiving that has limited you. In this case, the end may be a message to let something go. Anytime a door closes, another one opens and all endings hold the seeds of a new beginning.

All the people that appear in our dreams represent an aspect of who we are/were or might be. These characters can personify emerging or unknown aspects or areas of the self undergoing exploration. Dreams seem to say that the same process might be happening in our daily existence. What if all the people on our path are meant to teach us something about ourselves? This is what is occuring in the dreamscape. There are no enemies and none of us are victims. We simply bring our baggage (good and bad) into situations to identify what parts of us should be strengthened - and what parts of us are unproductive and may need to be discarded. When a dream presents a character that threatens you or is at odds with what you are trying to do - examine how this character might represent your own unconscious tendencies. The enemy tests your vision, sincerity and sense of direction. You are the hero on a journey to activate your potential and discover your destiny. Just as the characters that test the hero of our ancient myths activate Self Awareness - the 'enemies' that appear in dreams and on your path are serving the same purpose.

Feeling trapped can signify your own self limiting ideas - and seeking an escape can portray how you are moving to broaden your options. The dream is exploring the limitations you place on yourself where buildings can portray work; houses can portray ideas; and escaping in a vehicle through streets can symbolize needed changes in motivation or a new sense of direction so that you can find fulfillment. Escaping through doors can represent being open to opportunity, while escaping through windows symbolize a change in perspective or how you see the world. Since everything in a dream is embodying your inner world - you need only open the things you close so that you can move freely.

As you grow, you are trained to express behavior that is ‘correct and good.’ Your more natural way of expressing yourself in behaviors that may have been classified as bad, can become repressed within the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>unconscious</strong></a>. Maybe you were exuberant when your family was not. This part of your nature does not go way, but continues to seek expression. Dreaming is a way for the psyche to express and integrate unprocessed qualities that you believe are not acceptable.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/nightmare\"><strong>Nightmares</strong></a> or dreaming of something evil is actually the personification of your own <em>misplaced</em> power. They are a sign that something powerful and good (yet unexpressed) is coming to the surface.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Nature abhors a vacuum and energy that is created does not disappear; <em>it simply transforms</em>. Unprocessed ideas can fund a fear of a <em>boogeyman</em> or the enemy '<em>out there' </em>who simply mirrors how you might confront the things you are hiding <em>in here</em>.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The less this energy finds natural and outward expression, the more powerfully it colors dreams,\n",
    "giving added charge and dimension to your encounters. If you are brave enough to open the door of your fears, you would find your childish and disowned nature, standing on a stool like the Wizard in the story of Oz. The by-product of disowning your natural vitality is how you create the idea of good and evil <em>out there </em>to avoid taking responsibility for what is happening <em>in here</em>.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The ancient stories at the root of western religion personified good and evil as opposing characters. Nature teaches us how opposite forces simply drive life in a state of change. What we might label as bad is the way that something evolves before we can understand its purpose. The ancient Greeks first described evil as the uncivilized passions that were not actively under the control of the will. As these ideas were tossed through the hands of time, and applied to dogma, the image of evil merely gives us permission to become victims.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Today, psychologists agree that evil is something that is committed by people conflicted by inner crisis. While you may believe that there is some mysterious or negative influence working against you, life has been committed to your success since the beginning. Denying or repressing anything only gives it the power to <em>overwhelm you</em>. Because it is repressed, it can become obsessive and compulsively driven. You become drawn to the very situations you fear because the psyche, like any other part of the body, seeks to process any energy that is unhealthy and counter-productive.

Perhaps you are holding onto resentment or unproductive thoughts that need to be 'eliminated.' When you cannot find the proper place to relieve yourself - the dream can be suggesting that rather than projecting or dumping your condition on others - simply let these unproductive feelings (generally anger or resentment) go. There is no designated place for this type of healing or release - it is something that happens within - so examine what you are holding onto. Just as the body takes in nourishment and releases waste - the mind too, remains healthy when you can let the unnecessary go.

The natural energy released shows the extent of how repressing emotions is not healthy. This type of dream explores the necessity of releasing feelings so you can be renewed and open to a changing world. In a dream, seeing the explosion of an atomic bomb and its threat of ‘radio-activity,’ can also warn of the psychological manifestation of physical symptoms due to the inability to recognize and process anger. An explosion is a positive sign that the past can be released so something new can grow in its place.

This is how dreaming becomes a healthy aspect of psychic health.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">• When you are ‘stuck’ in a transformative cycle, the dream always reveals ‘the way through.’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">• If your dream recurs, it should be given careful consideration.

The body holds an inherent wisdom that allows it to heal itself, which requires no thought or action on your part. Similarly, the process of dreaming can be viewed as a perceptive or parasympathetic ‘organ’ that achieves a type of ‘healing’ while you sleep.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">• Dreams often present the exact opposite of what you believe to be true about yourself. Often sharing them with another person will allow you to recognize how the dream reflects what you are ‘missing’ about your current circumstance.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">• Understanding your dreams can lead to balance and wellness as well as helping you to become more assertive and self-confident.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">See <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/dream-basics\"><strong>Dream Basics</strong></a> and <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/dream-processing\"><strong>Dream Processing</strong></a>.<br></p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/failing\">Failing</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1526615735835-530c611a3d8a?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxGYWlsaW5nfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"gray cushion chairs on white tile flooring\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kylejglenn?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Kyle Glenn</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The sense of humiliation that comes with failing in real life when transferred into the dreamscape, often comes with intensified emotion. Dreams always offer a playground to explore and process anxiety. You may have anxiety about succeeding in something you are working on, and dreaming\n",
    "about failing is a way of lessening or releasing unproductive worry and tension. If the issue is from long ago or not related to a current event, the dream may be exploring self-defeating thoughts. In real life, you may hold back your emotions and some incident can ‘set you off’ with more emotion than the situation warranted. In the same way, the psyche takes a similar opportunity, by using ‘short range’ or passing situations to work through ‘longer range’ issues that can lead to wellness and balance. Dreams about failing that have nothing to do with the present should be explored to understand how the symbolism might represent misplaced self-worth.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/fair\">Fair</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1525091074452-87ed5709f708?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxGYWlyfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"girl standing outside building with LED lights and graphic wall\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jannesvdw?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Jannes Van den wouwer</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreaming of being at a fair can symbolize the need to incorporate more enjoyment in what you are doing.

Autumn in a dream portrays the idea that a period of outward building to achieve success may be approaching a more introspective period. Sensing that the season has changed to autumn can coincide with having children moving out of the house or going into retirement. Although the earth moves toward incubation, an enormous amount of energy is building for a springtime to come.

Where flying suggests an awareness that can transcend self-restraint, falling suggests the anxiety associated with setting unrealistic goals. Another reason that is suggested for the common occurrence of ‘falling dreams’ is that some part of the psyche is aware of ‘falling asleep’ or ‘sinking’ into a state of unconsciousness during dreaming.

Dreams of this type often take place after an experience that has left you wondering about your personal dynamics.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams are often portrayed in cycles of three, where one dreamscape morphs into two other settings. The first part of the dream suggests the crisis at hand, while the second part of the dream often includes family members as a way of exploring early dynamics that were inherited, and may need to be released. The third part is usually the most bizarre, offering clues to your transformational process. You wake up and dismiss the peculiar when this is the most relevant part of the dream. The psyche seeks to break through in any way it can. The things you find most difficult to face will appear in symbolism that leaves you puzzled. Family dynamics that you have inherited offer an enormous pallet of symbols for transformation as you move forward to discover your real identity.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Natural selection drives divergence in character because the more diversified we are, the better will be our chance for survival. Even family members within a particular species are endowed with variations. This ensures that competition for short supply in a shared environment is minimized. The family can be a source of support, even while their dynamics shape you like water shapes a stone. In the contrast of your differences, they often reveal your deeper color. You simply stand in the present as life’s best example of one variation of the line you carry forward.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The characters that appear in dreams are always portraying aspects of you. Siblings can personify your competitiveness or aspects that you associate with them, while parents suggest motherly and fatherly traits within you.

If something is unknown or not classified as good, it tends to go hand in hand with fear. We seek stasis, while life leads us to move beyond\n",
    "our tendency to hold to the familiar. Every plant and animal on the earth has outlasted a struggle for existence that is three and a half billion years old. Driven toward survival, overcoming fear is never second nature.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Fear and anxiety fund a large portion of what we dream. Why? Because we spend all of our lives trying to control the outcome. Change is the enemy unless we are the one orchestrating it. Dreams seem to push us beyond our need for control because growth is always easier when we are fearless.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams are a safe environment to explore insecurities and fears. In fact, the vast majority of dreams involve some type of conflict. Dreaming allows difficulties we are facing to be 'acted out' through symbolism. Much inner shifting and growth occurs even while we are not remembering our dreams. When facing crisis, we are told to 'sleep on it.' When we wake up the situation always looks different. This is because much processing goes on in the dream state. Fear too, is diminished in this way.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When you wake up remembering the dream or feel afraid, you carry the strangeness of the dream back into consciousness. Often the bizarre symbols will stay with you as you explore its possible meaning. Dreaming specifically arouses emotion as a wake up call (not necessarily bad) and feeling fear is a strong motivator for change. Even the most frightening dreams are a good sign that something powerful is stirring within and seeking expression.

Often dream imagery gets more frightening in proportion to your inability to face something. The message is not so much about danger, but that some aspect of the mind seeks expression. The more you are unwilling to allow it - the 'louder' it speaks. Dreams affect us in the same unspoken way as going to the movies. Their purpose is to dislodge the status quo so that we can be more responsive to how life is shaping us. Dreaming of an inability to feel brings this issue forward because you may not realize how cut off you are from your feelings.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/feet\">Feet</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1490274480207-c9140355abba?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxGZWV0fGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"white Converse All-Star low-tops\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nadineshaabana?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Nadine Shaabana</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Feet can symbolize the ability to stand on your 'own two feet' or the ability to walk away from difficulty.

She may dream of another woman's genitals as she explores her own sexuality and openness, along with the idea that she may be keeping some aspect of herself hidden that is now being examined. For a man, dreaming of breasts can symbolize the desire to be nurtured and cared for. He may dream of the womb/vagina as a symbol of transformation or connecting with his latent sensitivity.

Feeling trapped goes hand in hand with idea of being a victim, when in actuality you are the perpetrator of a perpetual cycle. That you are dreaming of a fence, suggests that you realize that ‘established boundaries’ can be torn down.

If you are waiting for a ferry, you may be too concerned with the idea of acceptance and are not able to express your real feelings. Since you are waiting, you may be giving the power to be fulfilled and autonomous in life to others, or to the whims of fate. The message might be to stop expecting and take responsibility for how you feel.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The condition of the water in relation to this type of boat ride can portray what is going on below 'the surface,' or how you really feel. Turbid water can represent old hurts that you need to process and release. Choppy or frightening water can represent a sense that you are not feeling in control of your emotions. Not being able to control what the ship is doing is the same thing as not taking responsibility for where you are going in life. The message of the dream might be to explore your feelings and sense of autonomy. If you wake up each day expecting difficulty - you will find it.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">If the theme is more of solace and peace - you may have recently overcome a period of crisis and are moving happily with the flow of events. Receiving acknowledgment in the social sphere also manifests as traveling on a ship with others over smooth water.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Explore what takes place on the ferry for additional insight into this emotional crossing.

In a more natural setting, you can be examining the part of your nature that is more natural and open. To dream of wandering into an empty field suggests a type of openness in meeting the future, where ideas can rise as inspiration. Regardless of what you are doing in the field, it is a symbol of expanding your awareness. Lush meadows can symbolize the fertile garden growing within you. You may come out of the forest after a difficult transition and arrive in the field as a representation of your newly expanded awareness. If the field reminds you of something from your childhood - you can be re-exploring your roots and limitations. If the field holds livestock, you can be exploring your spirited (horse) or domesticated (cow/goat) nature.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/fight\">Fight</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552072092-7f9b8d63efcb?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxGaWdodHxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"man standing and walking going on boxing ring surrounded with people\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@attentieattentie?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Attentie Attentie</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The idea of fighting with someone or something is slightly different from the fearful dream in which you are running away.

The character, drama or even the news has taken a format where you are 'entertaining the idea' but it has not yet been integrated.

This portrays a type of disconnect from the issue at hand and exploring the other symbolism in the dream will shed light on what it is.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Operas and concerts show how you are exploring harmony between various sides of you so that all can function in 'concert' or unison.

When you dream of finding or searching for something, it is because whatever aspect that symbol represents in daily life is not given much consideration. To ‘find’ it in a dream suggests that you must ‘find’ or discover it in daily life. For example, finding a watch can focus you on time and the stages of life. Finding clothes can be related to discovering your authentic identity. Finding money can be symbolic of discovering self-worth. Finding an ancient object can represent a side of you that has been buried and needs to be resurrected.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/finger\">Finger</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1604488912264-dfed70450d76?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxGaW5nZXJ8ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"man in gray crew neck shirt making thumbs up\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@usmanyousaf?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Usman Yousaf</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The finger can be a symbol that is pointing you toward something you are failing to see.

When you are denying anger it is because you are hurting in a way that you are unable to understand or process. Dreaming of fire and the other symbolism surrounding it can be a catharsis or healing vehicle for transcending an old way of repressing feelings that are holding you back. Whatever symbol is on fire may need to be released or your relationship to it needs to be redefined. Fire is also associated with sexual feelings that are not finding an outlet. Passion can also be symbolized by fire and it is important that you recognize how passion is currently at work for you. In this case, the fire can be a call to activate passion in work that has become routine. Seeing a building burn can represent the transformation of your belief system or attitudes.

Meeting police in a dream can be a symbol of restriction and the firefighter can symbolize dousing passion and anger. At work, you may be the ‘firefighter’ rushing in to solve everyone’s problems as a way of validating your worth. Perhaps there is insecurity surrounding your ability to delegate and as a problem solver, you find a road of many problems. Just as a person with a hammer sees only nails, a person with a fire extinguishing device will find many fires. As a character representing you, the firefighter may be ‘putting out your fire’ in terms of passion, sexuality and feelings. This character can also portray the defense mechanism at play in controlling anger or feelings. In this case, acknowledging anger may be required.

Fish live ‘below the surface’ and can portray how something previously unknown or unseen is actually alive and thriving. Any living thing associated with the sea will generally portray movement of the unconscious. Since ancient times, the fish has been associated with the idea of ‘trapping fate’ or a lucky break. You may dream of a fish when everything seems to be going your way. The different types of fish or creature and its <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong>Color</strong></a>, can shed light on how you are currently connecting with information from the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>unconscious</strong></a>. ‘A fish out of water’ is a symbol of the uncertainty you may feel in integrating your authentic nature with what is expected of you. Seeing fish in the air and out of water also symbolizes the free movement and release of what had previously been kept under the surface, as in an epiphany. People commonly dream of a fish floating in the air when a breakthrough is occuring through therapy or spiritual work. A dead fish often has an odor. It can symbolize an instinctive sense that ‘something doesn’t smell right’ or is 'fishy.' A dead fish can also symbolize how what you are hoping for is no longer an option. Finally, the fish can be symbolic of success, achievement and spiritual ideals.

    "go or opening to the unknown. A symbol floating in <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/water\"><strong>Water</strong></a> can symbolize an idea that has emerged from the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>unconscious</strong></a> that is connected to feelings. A dandelion seed floats in the wind, and has combined an intricate design with an ability to use the wind in its pursuit of regeneration. It expresses life's wonder and endless possibilities. In this way, floating can suggest finding a new way of seeing an ordinary situation. When you see a symbol suspended in the air that does not usually float, the message suggests seeing beyond the restrictions you have put on whatever the symbol represents. Fish can symbolize opportunity; a carpet can be a message about sweeping issues under the rug or also, a message about being swept away by fantasy. Any symbol that is floating or flying is being brought to a high level of awareness. As you let your defenses down and move toward intimacy with another, you have the sense of ‘floating on air.’ Floating or seeing another symbol float is often a good indication that you are letting go of self-restrictive tendencies. Explore the symbol that is floating for more clues about the need to open yourself to its possibilities.

To dream of turbulent water suggests a sense of emotional crisis associated with moving forward. Water flooding the feet can be symbolic of changes to the path that incorporate feelings and sensitivity. Water flooding into a house can represent integrating feelings with thoughts and ideas. Water flooding over ground can symbolize changes to your foundation that need to give way to feelings. Flooding can be a positive dream about being on the threshold of emotional growth and the release of feelings. In all of our ancient stories, water is the mysterious reservoir where the hero is to retrieve a treasure. Similarly, raging water often initiates you into a process of self-discovery. Floods can undermine the foundation of your beliefs until you are forced to let go. What you thought was solid and what you thought you needed, is washed away in the pursuit of basic survival or real fulfillment. Water can also represent health and wellness since it is a symbol of the elixir of life.

You may be dreaming and suddenly ‘wake up inside of the dream’ to realize that anything is possible and that you can fly. This is an aspect of the psyche exploring potential against self-imposed limitations. Flying can symbolize aspirations and the ability to achieve your goals. The ability to fly in a dream can also be expressing a sense of power and accomplishment. It encourages the idea of how closely experience is tied to thought and beliefs. The flying dream generally occurs during periods of successful achievement or heightened inspiration.

We dream of food when we are seeking more reward from what we do, or are seeking deeper meaning in our relationships. If you are hungry in a dream, you are exploring what you need. Food and its connections to others or events suggests your hunger for success in this area. If eating is disrupting something you are attempting to do, then you are not finding fulfillment and need to ‘digest’ something to achieve satisfaction.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The different places where you eat can offer clues as to the area of life that is currently under exploration. A <strong><em>kitchen</em></strong> is associated with your upbringing, while <strong><em>restaurants</em></strong> portray social exchanges or public recognition. Food related to work imagery suggests the way you are seeking more reward and fulfillment in your work. Food associated with cars will symbolize your motivation or what you may be doing that is undermining fulfillment for you.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Bread</em></strong> and <strong><em>water</em></strong> represent basic needs, where bread can symbolize the body, and water -the emotions. Bread also has associations with money and when it is <strong><em>toasted</em></strong>, it can represent how you are being 'seasoned' by experience, or the sense that you are 'ready.' <strong><em>Toast</em></strong> can also symbolize a fear of failure or the sense that it is time to go. The nourishment that is taken in by ‘<strong><em>drinking</em></strong>’ is associated with a ‘thirst’ for something describing necessity, luxury and pleasure, like ‘lapping it up’ and ‘drinking it in.’ <strong><em>Milk</em></strong> actually takes the idea of nourishment a little deeper because of its associations with mother and childhood.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Cake</em></strong> or <strong><em>desserts</em></strong> represent enjoyment or becoming more open in the sense of ‘having your cake and eating it too.’ Dreaming of desserts symbolizes a desire to truly enjoy life as in 'icing on the cake' or reward from the sense of receiving one's 'just desserts.' Since desserts are not considered fundamental nourishment and tend to gratify our desires, they have associations with seeking reward, perhaps when considering changing careers or exploring love, and how it can nourish you. <strong><em>Vegetables</em></strong> will have associations with their shapes and colors, often portraying sexual needs and the idea of doing what is good for us. Vegetables that grow beneath the earth, such as <strong><em>carrots</em></strong>, <strong><em>potatoes</em></strong>, <strong><em>onions </em></strong>and <strong><em>radishes</em></strong> often suggest how you are gestating or not actively acknowledging what is growing within. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/corn\"><strong><em>Corn</em></strong></a> has a special significance because of its association with teeth and ears, signifying increased sensitivity and perception. The carrot is a symbol of ambition, as in going after the ‘carrot.’ <strong><em>Onions</em></strong> have many layers and can portray the intricate layers that need to be peeled way to discover sustenance. At the same time, onions make you cry and can symbolize the need\n",
    "to allow something painful to surface so that you can move to greener pastures. <strong><em>Plants</em></strong> that require that you care for them while growing, suggest that you must prune or nurture your sense of nourishment and fulfillment over time.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Fruit on a Tree </em></strong>presents a type of food, where sustenance is there for you, to be taken from the ‘Tree of Life.’ <strong><em>Apples</em></strong> can represent consequences, or achievement and effort, as something that grows and falls to the earth. <strong><em>Apples</em></strong> and <strong><em>oranges</em></strong> can suggest health associated with their power to heal, although an orange is sometimes odd, since nothing rhymes with orange. Orange is also associated with the color that makes something stand out or requires attention. The <strong><em>lemon</em></strong> can be associated with a sour attitude or missing out on something and feeling jealous. Dreaming of fruit suggests that something exists within your reach and you need only ‘pluck it’ to be more fulfilled. <strong>Meat</strong> has an association with ‘hunting’ or sexual nourishment, while <strong><em>milk </em></strong>suggests attainment and satisfaction in the sense of ‘the land of milk and honey’ or ‘mother’s milk’ flowing from the breast.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/foreign-people-and-places\">Foreign People and Places</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1554539484-e4fab56d4a5c?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxGb3JlaWduJTIwUGVvcGxlJTIwYW5kJTIwUGxhY2VzfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"women playing outdoor sports\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@johntorcasio?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">John Torcasio</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Going to a foreign city means that you are exploring social needs that are new or unfamiliar.

We are usually in the front when we are making changes to how we approach or interact with others. Dreaming of the front door or front yard shows how we move toward opportunity or how we socialize (unlike the back area that we keep more private.) Focusing on the front of any object seems to suggest appearance or how something seems on the surface - although the truth may be different. The front side of the body, especially as it relates to what we wear portrays the identity and the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/persona\"><strong>Persona</strong></a>. Just as we 'con front' situations - these dreams show us stepping out or changing how we appear or how we do things.

Floating furniture is a message to lighten up and can signify changes to ideas you have long held to be sacred. Often associated with a specific room, furniture represents your ideas in relation to the area of the psyche described in <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/houses-and-buildings\"><strong>Houses and Buildings</strong></a>. You may explore your idea of sexuality on a bed, although if the dream focuses particularly on the <strong><em>bed</em></strong>, it suggests that you are exploring a new way of understanding your sexual needs. Sometimes you will find yourself doing unusual things on the bed as your psyche exercises the opportunity to break free from restraint to allow for the free expression of your sexuality. Furniture associated with a kitchen can portray how you are moving toward fulfillment in a broader sense, so you may become more nourished by experience. Items associated with the living room show ideas related to social exchanges with others, while the family room can portray ideas adopted from family. Looking through <strong><em>cupboards</em>, <em>cabinets</em></strong>&nbsp;or <strong><em>armoire</em></strong> can be how you explore ideas that have been hidden away but remain important. Consider the symbol that is found in thae cabinet and how it might be brought out or tapped to achieve fulfillment.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A <strong><em>chair</em></strong> captures the seat of your ideas and can symbolize ideas from the past in which you take comfort. It’s <em>condition, <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong>colors</strong></a> and patterns</em> can offer clues to the ideas that are being explored. The <strong><em>couch</em></strong> and <strong><em>sofa</em></strong> reveal adopted behaviors associated with family dynamics. A <strong><em>footstool </em></strong>or <strong><em>ottoman</em></strong> can signify ideas associated with your life direction, or at the root of your motivation. The <strong><em>table</em></strong> is a place where things are ‘out in the open’ or displayed for public view, as in 'out on the table.' Items on a table can suggest the current way you are expressing yourself. A <strong><em>lamp</em></strong> provides additional light or insight, and can symbolize something from the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>unconscious</strong></a> that is attempting ‘to come to light.’ The <strong><em>carpet</em></strong> or <strong><em>rug</em></strong> is often a symbol of sweeping issues ‘under the rug’ as you move forward. <strong><em>Patterns in a rug </em></strong>or a<strong><em> tapestry </em></strong>can portray how you are exploring the part you play in creating your circumstances. See <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/houses-and-buildings\"><strong>Houses and Buildings </strong></a>for additional insight on specific furniture.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div></div></div></div>\n",

The side of you that makes you different from others is being explored.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/gale\">Gale</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1563393932010-ddd879028ea2?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxHYWxlfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"landscape photography of body of water\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@matthewwaring?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Matthew Waring</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">An extreme wind that would be called a gale can portray your fears about how quickly change is being thrust upon you.

Why is the person being hung? Are they being punished unjustly? The person being hung can represent your own tendency to punish yourself with self criticism. Seeing a hanging can also portray feeling constricted or unable to freely expand your horizons. Dreams present a safe environment to explore conflict and crisis. When the setting of a dream involves gallows where someone is to be hung - the message can be that you are sabotaging some aspect of yourself. Examine the character that is being hung to see if it might represent a side of you that is feeling suffocated or unexpressed. Hanging is also associated with being in a state of suspension. You may also be harboring a sense of guilt that is undermining your ability to stand up for yourself.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/gambling\">Gambling</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1552749412-091909ed9f82?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxHYW1ibGluZ3xlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"two white dice cubes\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@heathergill?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Heather Gill</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Going gambling can suggest a willingness to try something new.

Breasts often relate to how you are exploring self-nurturing ideas and behavior. For a woman, breasts can symbolize what she gives of value to society, from the sense of how breasts nourish new life. Female genitalia for a woman will signify her essence or deeper connection to life. To a man, female body parts reflect issues related to sensitivity while he explores the 'undeveloped' traits associated with femininity. Male genitals for a man can represent his power and life force, while a woman dreaming of male genitals can represent being more empowered or aggressive.

The gorilla can symbolize rage or anger or an aspect of power that is not being expressed. It is typical for a woman to dream of a gorilla or King Kong creature when she is approaching menstrual changes as a symbol of the immense power that her body holds over her. Kissing this creature can symbolize connecting with these life stages in a positive way. For a man, the gorilla can capture a sense of being overly-masculine at the expense of one's sensitivity.

Just as the Unknown <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/child\"><strong>Child</strong></a> in a dream can represent the birth of new sides of you, dreaming of the matriarch and patriarch of the family can portray the development of a more wise side of you that has been seasoned by the transformation. Often the grandparent can be viewed as the Wise One Archetype activated after a period of intense soul searching or difficulty, now awakened as an aspect of the Self. In some cases a grandparent can represent the objective exploration of dynamics associated with the parent that is related to them. In this case, you may not be acknowledging the positive characteristics inherited by this parent.

For example, drowning and grasping for something for survival brings forward the idea of being overwhelmed with fearful feelings. <em>That thing </em>you are grasping for (as a symbol for exploration) will provide clues to how you might integrate it to find wellness. The hand represents both taking and giving. Grasping something so that you do not lose it suggests desperation and perhaps, an unhealthy relationship to whatever it is.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/grass\">Grass</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1567459169668-95d355371bda?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxHcmFzc3xlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\"\n",

This can be a symbol of relaxation and a sense satisfaction. All things that are growing share the common symbolism of nurturing, however grass grows abundantly and multiplies quickly as an image of inter-related concepts. Tall grass can show how ideas are free flowing and growing, while manicured grass shows ideas that are being tailored to meet others expectations. Walking in the grass can symbolize getting more grounded and natural - as opposed to dreams about streets, concrete and other man-made structures.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/grave\">Grave</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581588525251-e1dca48e9827?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxHcmF2ZXxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"water on gray concrete stairs\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@greyharpoon?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Kenny Orr</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Visiting a grave in a dream can be a way of exploring ideas or feelings that are buried.

The condition of the hair can symbolize how you currently relate to your ideas. If you are sporting a strange hairdo, you may feel that your ideas are crazy or not acceptable. If you have hair of an unusual color, explore the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong>color</strong></a> for information about ideas that are being adopted or need to be considered. For example, if your hair is straight but you dream that it is curly, the dream can be guiding you to lighten up. If your hair is curly and you dream that it is straight, the dream might be suggesting that you 'straighten out' your thinking or tone it down. Changing haircolor shows the shifting of focus in whatever you associate with the color. Body hair can portray a need to be more natural in your expression.

The type of hairstyle can also portray different attitudes where a short haircut can relate to being conservative; long, flowing hair can suggest being more natural or earthy; and a clean shaven head can symbolize a rebirth in outlook. Examine what is being done to the hair for information about how your ideas and attitude are being shaped.

Consider where you lost your handbag for information about where you are placing your priorities. This is a very personal symbol that reveals who you really are and what you 'carry with you' daily. Losing the purse can also coincide with financial insecurity when you are exploring change in career pursuits.

Dysfunctional issues related to a house can represent certain physical parts of the body. Non working parts of a car too, can also portray the physical body. Many times <strong><em>vehicle doors </em></strong>or <strong><em>lower</em></strong> and <strong><em>upper rooms </em></strong>of a house will depict aspects of the body, offering a message about your health and well-being.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The <strong><em>front door </em></strong>can suggest arms and the <strong><em>back doors </em></strong>can represent legs. <strong><em>Lighting</em></strong> can be electrical circuitry or neurological, while <strong><em>water</em></strong> problems can be vascular or reflect ‘plumbing.’ Water appearing as a threat is usually associated with emotional issues. The <strong><em>top floor </em></strong>of a building can represent the head, while the <strong><em>rooms\n",
    "below </em></strong>can suggest various parts of the lower body. Protecting a ‘<strong><em>treasure</em></strong>’ can signify repression at the root of illness, while searching for a <strong>key</strong> is often the clue to achieving wellness.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">If you are experiencing ‘dis-ease’, where it is taking place in the body is as important as why. If the left leg is suffering, look for its representation in dreams of the back or lower left portion of a structure or vehicle. Sometimes before a physical manifestation will appear, you are warned of over indulgence or things that can impact wellness. This is most obvious in the border-line alcoholic who is always dreaming of searching for something with images related to alcohol. Many therapists recognize repression at the root of illness. Since dreams portray what you are repressing, they are a profound tool in achieving wellness and balance.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/hearing\">Hearing</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1596088869451-491e167efabb?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxIZWFyaW5nfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"person wearing white and black sunglasses\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mark0polo?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Mark Paton</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><div><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreaming of issues related to your ability to hear often point directly to the idea that <em>you are not listening</em>.

A beggar or vagabond is a character that can portray a lack of self esteem or the ways that you kid yourself into believing you are happy. You may be going through some type of routine and not acknowledging your lack of fulfillment. The appearance of this character and how you relate to them allows you to explore your own sense of homelessness or the idea that you are not grounded. Sometimes this type of character will appear like the Fool or <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/trickster\"><strong>Trickster</strong></a> that trips you up in your inconsistencies. Often they will pester you as a way of making you look back at yourself honestly.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/homonyms\">Homonyms</a></h3><div><div></div><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><div><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Since dreams have an uncanny way of breaking through your defensive barriers, often a homonym or 'play on words' will be used. A homonym is a word that <em>sounds like </em>one thing when it is actually tricking you into exploring another. In this way, dreams have clever ways of ‘tripping you up.’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">For example: if you dream of saying something <strong><em>aloud,</em></strong>you repeat it back, and you are suddenly saying what a part of you is not <strong><em>allowed </em></strong>to say, as in the case of discussing difficult ideas you’d rather not discuss. Someone may give you ten <strong><em>cents</em></strong> as a part of you explores the idea of <strong><em>sense</em></strong> or the increased ability to feel and acknowledge your self-worth. The idea of time and how you may be missing the importance of the present, can be symbolized by a <strong><em>watch</em></strong> and the idea of <strong><em>watching. </em></strong>Approaching the <strong><em>altar</em></strong> often coincides with times when you <strong><em>alter</em></strong> or change your behavior; Inside of a <strong><em>cell </em></strong>can be a way of understanding the ideas that you <strong><em>sell</em></strong> to others. When the original word doesn't seem to make sense, explore whether it may be a homonym or word play of this type.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The dream can focus on a <strong><em>duel</em></strong> as a way of understanding <strong><em>dual</em></strong>, or the two conflicting ideas that have brought you into crisis. An <strong><em>urn</em></strong> can be a way of understanding what you <strong><em>earn</em></strong> as you explore self-worth. When a <strong><em>maid</em></strong> appears to make the bed, you are given the opportunity to understand what you have <strong><em>made</em></strong> of circumstances, in the sense of ‘making your bed and lying in it too.’ Hearing the word <strong><em>morning</em></strong> or a dream that is focused on the morning can also have an association with <strong><em>mourning</em></strong> or feelings of sadness that remain unprocessed.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">You may dream of a <strong><em>mummy</em></strong> in the first stages of recognizing things that were adopted from <strong><em>mommy</em></strong> that may need to be relinquished. Dreaming of a <strong>witch</strong> can suggest how one thing leads to another or unacknowledged choices as in <strong>which</strong>. To <strong><em>knead</em></strong> bread is the same as the idea that you may need money or are overly focused on material security. The number <strong><em>six</em></strong> often appears as a cryptic way of getting the idea of <strong><em>sex </em></strong>out on the table. The number <strong><em>eight </em></strong>can be associated with eating issues or the need to digest something as in <strong><em>ate.</em></strong> Seeing a <strong><em>knot</em></strong> can suggest <strong><em>not</em></strong>, while untying a knot can be the idea of removing 'not' from your vocabulary when you are opening up. An <strong><em>oar</em></strong> can be <strong><em>or</em></strong>, offering the idea that the resolution is something you perhaps, are not considering. <em>Tents</em> can suggest nervousness or being <strong><em>tense</em></strong>, and focusing on a <strong><em>vein</em></strong> can signify being <strong><em>vain</em></strong>. Dreaming of a lion can suggest that someone is telling lies.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/homosexuality\">Homosexuality</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1574522377847-1b41df6c2921?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxIb21vc2V4dWFsaXR5fGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"Homosexuality\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@konkarampelas?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Kon Karampelas</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A very common dream, yet often misunderstood, is dreaming of performing sexual acts with the same gender. Especially in the work setting, dreaming of connecting with others in an intimate way can symbolize how you are exploring and integrating the attributes or behavior of another. In a competitive situation, 'mounting' can be a symbol of your feelings about becoming more dominant or being dominated in the work environment. Being intimate with the same sex is a way of ‘incorporating’ the deeper aspects of either the feminine (sensitive/intuitive) or masculine (assertive/empowered) nature. This type of dream can also be exploring your hunger or lack of affection from either your mother or father and how you are transforming the role modeling that you adopted.

The house can personify personal aspects in how the mind is compartmentalized. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/buildings\"><strong>Buildings</strong></a> and public places relate more to work issues, or feelings of seeking acknowledgment in social interaction.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Commonly, you will dream of a <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/childhood-home\"><strong>house from childhood </strong></a>with some new <strong><em>additions</em></strong>, representing the way that the self is constructed in childhood, although it continues to evolve as you explore potential and change over time.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Specific <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/room\"><strong>rooms</strong></a> are associated with aspects of the self and its <strong><em>decoration</em></strong> and <strong><em>architecture</em></strong> can portray your emerging ‘style.’ If the architecture seems <strong><em>grand</em></strong> or <strong><em>expansive</em></strong>, the message can be about opening or broadening your outlook. <strong><em>Palatial spaces </em></strong>can sometimes represent a fear of intimacy. When the <strong><em>walls seem constricting </em></strong>or <strong><em>dingy</em></strong>, the message can signify how your own ideas limit you. If the decoration has <strong><em>animal patterns</em></strong>, the message can be about being more grounded and earthy. If the <strong><em>room is well lit</em></strong>, you are exploring ideas in active consciousness; if <strong><em>dark</em></strong> - whatever is being explored is presently unknown or untapped within you. See also <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong><em>Colors</em></strong></a>.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The <strong><em>attic</em></strong> signifies higher thought or spiritual ideas, but can also suggest the ideas you store and collect or how you must ‘climb upward’ or raise consciousness to sort through what you no longer need to store and protect. The attic can be associated with the critical tapes of conscience where you explore self limiting ideas.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The <strong><em>basement</em></strong> is the subconscious or area of the self that you keep ‘below the surface.’ Commonly, you will dream of basements when you are going through therapy and sorting through the past. <strong><em>New or undiscovered rooms </em></strong>will suggest aspects of the self you are unaware of, but are currently being explored for potential. The ‘<strong><em>living’ room </em></strong>is a social place to explore interactions with others and your mindset in meeting others, while the ‘<strong><em>bed</em></strong>’ and ‘<strong><em>bath’ rooms </em></strong>are representative of ‘coming clean’ or exploring your sexuality. These types of dreams bring these ideas to the forefront specifically because you are not open to them during the day. If your <strong><em>house is shifting </em></strong>on the foundation, sliding or crumbling, perhaps negative ideas need to crumble as a representation of how your foundation of beliefs must be renewed over time.

    "portrays work and issues relating to how you are currently providing for yourself or your role and sense of achievement in life. The <strong><em>hearth</em></strong> or <strong><em>fireplace</em></strong> often symbolizes your sense of heritage and what you hold to be sacred. Since it is associated with <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/fire\"><strong>fire</strong></a>, the idea of family dynamics and emotional well being are being portrayed.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Hallways</em></strong> are places of transition, where you meet others in ‘neutral space’ and often appear when you are exploring choices or going through a transition. The ‘<strong><em>front’ yard </em></strong>or <strong><em>garden</em></strong> is what you are making of yourself for ‘public view.’ The ‘<strong><em>back’ yard </em></strong>is suggestive of more organic aspects, which are not made obvious to others. Focusing on foliage or growth in a garden can symbolize how you are nourishing developing traits. You often discover or search for something or explore the correctness of your behavior ‘in the <strong><em>bushes</em></strong>’ or ‘in the <strong><em>shadows</em></strong>.’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>Buildings</strong> sometimes appear as <strong><em>rickety structures</em></strong>, representing how you grow to meet a future that has not yet been erected or ‘solidified.’ Buildings can be places in which you are <strong><em>lost or searching for something</em></strong>, as in the case of searching for a new identity when changing jobs. By traveling to a <strong><em>specific floor </em></strong>or level of consciousness, you can also find yourself <strong><em>outside of your work building </em></strong>or on the <strong><em>roof</em></strong> as you take an objective view of leaving a job because the <strong><em>ceiling </em></strong>isn't high enough. <strong><em>Stairs</em></strong> going up can symbolize exploring aspirations, while stairs going down symbolize retracing steps or understanding the root of your motivation. The <strong><em>floor</em></strong> of a structure can be indicative of levels of awareness or may be associated with the meaning of the <strong><em>number</em></strong> involved: See <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/numbers\"><strong>Numbers</strong></a>. You stand on the <strong><em>ground floor </em></strong>of awareness and travel <strong><em>upward</em></strong> to achieve your ideals, or <strong><em>downward</em></strong> to find those things that you keep hidden below. <strong><em>Elevators and escalators</em></strong> in a building can also symbolize aspirations or how your upward or downward journey feels orchestrated beyond your control.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The<strong><em> roof </em></strong>of a structure shows limitations. As a setting of activity, something taking place on a roof can portray your desire to break through barriers in achieving your ambitions. When the ‘sky is the limit’ the <strong><em>ceiling</em></strong> can block your ambitions, suggesting how self-defeating ideas may be blocking your ability to discover success.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Opening a <strong><em>door</em></strong> suggests objectivity or discovery associated with the symbolism of where the door may lead. The door can lead to certain rooms as a way of opening to the area associated with that room. Doors can mean many things: boundaries and unblocking potential, while knocking is often a sexual symbol. The ‘<strong><em>front’ door </em></strong>leads you ‘out’ into the world, suggesting the barrier between the self and the social realm. The <strong><em>‘back’ </em></strong>and ‘<strong><em>side’ doors </em></strong>allow for an ‘escape’ or for ‘intruder’ like characters who appear as aspects of you that remain unacknowledged and integrated.

Sometimes you may find yourself looking for a ‘<strong><em>key</em></strong>’ in a church as a way of suggesting how self-criticism and/or severe conscience is trapping your organic nature through illness or dis-ease. See Key under <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/purses-wallets-luggage-jewels-and-keys\"><strong>Purses, Wallets, Luggage, Jewels and Keys.</strong></a></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A <strong><em>school</em></strong> suggests learning experiences or being measured against others in your abilities where the teacher can represent wisdom from your higher Self. The <strong><em>library</em></strong> can represent communication or ideas that you store. Searching through <strong><em>books</em></strong> can symbolize exploring ideas adopted in the past, and how they affect your view of the present. Being given a book can symbolize direction from higher sides of you. A <strong><em>gymnasium</em></strong> is a place of competition and often appears when you are learning to balance two sides or conflicting desires. the <strong><em>locker room </em></strong>combines the idea of competition and recognition, with changing identity since you store your valuables in a <strong><em>locker.</em></strong> The <strong><em>factory</em></strong> often appears when you are exploring how learning new skills can increase your effectiveness and worth in the market. A <strong><em>warehouse</em></strong> shows your reserves or what you are falling back on or exploring during crisis. The warehouse is also a symbol of where old ideas are stored.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/hospital\"><strong><em>hospital</em></strong></a>is a place of personal crisis; or where you might find ‘critical’ care when you are out of options in making a change. You may visit the hospital in a dream as a message about getting help with the transition. Being in a hospital is often a sign that you are not aware of how your thinking is holding you back. It is often a call for help when you are not moving easily through a type of transformation. Hospitals and <strong><em>emergency rooms </em></strong>can also represent ‘new life’ or the place where you are ‘born’ into a new way of interacting. When <strong><em>doctors </em></strong>and <strong><em>nurses </em></strong>offer you advice, you should give the message careful consideration as an aspect that may enhance your ‘well-being.’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A <strong><em>shopping center </em></strong>reflects ‘shopping’ for new ways of being and exploring a sense of self worth and values. <strong><em>Markets and shopping areas </em></strong>also show how you are exploring commerce and work when you are making a change. <strong><em>Restaurants</em></strong> and <strong><em>cafes</em></strong> often appear in dreams when you are exploring how your path might lead to better fulfillment. The <strong><em>waiter</em></strong> or <strong><em>waitress</em></strong> can symbolize traits within you that you are not considering that can allow your work to become for fulfilling.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/hung\">Hung</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1542189040-5068617c8d2e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxIdW5nfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"multicolored buildings\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@florianwehde?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Florian Wehde</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams present a safe environment to explore conflict and crisis.

Examine the character that is being hung to see if it might represent a side of you that is feeling suffocated or unexpressed. Hanging is also associated with being in a state of suspension, while something suspended in the air can represent an opportunity that you are not seeing.

It is common to be doing something work related in a dream - only to be focused on the food or eating when it doesn't seem appropriate. That is because your dream is connecting the idea of fulfillment to your need for recognition at work, or the need to find the more fulfilling work.

Seeing something frozen, or encased in ice and lifeless, can signify your awareness that some aspect of you is inanimate, possibly because of fear: ‘frozen with fear.’ Dreaming of walking on ice can show the precarious result of trying to skim over emotions. You can 'fall in' and be consumed by them - as in the case of holding in feelings only to explode at the least little incident.

In waking life, you have the sense of being isolated or separate from everything around you, but at microscopic levels, all of life can be observed to be interdependent and behaving as one giant organism.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When Einstein penetrated the secrets of the molecular world, he remarked: <em>“Nature does not distinguish between mass and energy but observes them to be one and the same.”</em> He also revealed how our idea of space and time being distinct was incorrect: they are interwoven. His work transformed our understanding of the natural world, revealing our tendency to compartmentalize every aspect, as if each might exist independently. We now realize that there are no isolated building blocks, only the intricate relationship of how each part is an observable variation of a larger whole. It is we, who “must become open” if we are to understand nature’s more holistic interconnectivity. Dreams operate from a more organic awareness and present the first clues that our normal perceptive orientation may not be accurate.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">We\n",
    "are brought together propitiously to learn from each other. In dreams, we see how characters portray the emerging and changing sides of ourselves. Perhaps dreams can teach us how we can become more observant and learn from our interactions with others.

In dreams they can represent social interaction and the strong pull of peer pressure.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Insects operate in social structures that are similar to ours, and can suggest ideas about being a team player, or getting caught up in what we believe is required of us. Because they are viewed as pests, they can symbolize social issues that are 'bugging' us.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As a symbol of <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>unconscious</strong></a> processes, they appear ‘driven’ like soldiers, without any sense of consciousness about what they are doing. When <strong><em>ants</em></strong> appear, they are often associated with food and therefore, can suggest not feeling like you are getting what you deserve. <strong><em>Spiders</em></strong> are not insects, but appear as such, hiding in webs and threatening to bite, representing insecurity or feeling pursued or trapped in your growth by being afraid. Spiders can also represent the web of how various influences are tied together. <strong><em>Larvae</em></strong> and <strong><em>flying insects </em></strong>can portray metamorphosis and the ability to transform. <strong><em>Worms</em></strong> can actually be a positive symbol about a type of life that stirs beneath the surface or what you fail to recognize. They regenerate the soil and can symbolize transforming difficulty into something positive. <strong><em>Moths</em></strong> appear to be compulsively drawn to any type of light and can represent obsessively being drawn toward what you feel you need. At the same time, the moth can symbolize spiritual pursuits or a desire to bring something to light. Just as insects build their <strong><em>hives</em></strong>, <strong><em>webs</em></strong> and <strong><em>underground tunnels</em></strong>, dreaming of insects will often suggest how whatever is bugging you is self-created. Often dreaming of bees can be a play on words and the way the clever psyche is exploring the idea of being, or the sense of 'just do it....just be.' A honeybee can combine the idea of sweetness and pollination as a message about lightness of being.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/inside\">Inside</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1466151781656-41b0002fd529?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxJbnNpZGV8ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"three men inside music studio\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@iamjohnhult?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">John Hult</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The difference between being inside and outside in a dream emphasizes whether we are exploring private issues (inside) or whether the issue relates to making a debut or changing how we interact with others (outside.)

If you have an accident and find out your insurance doesn't cover it, you may feel that you are setting goals that are unrealistic. The insurance policy can be understood in terms of what you are investing symbolically to ensure your success. Generally this type of dream is teaching you to be honest in understanding your capabilities. If the dream is resolved by getting insurance money, the message can suggest that you have more reserves (in terms of capabilities/self-esteem) than you thought possible. Insurance related to the home can embody the idea that life is a learning experience that requires continual transformation. Insurance related to the car revolves around the issue of drive and motivation. Insurance related to health can have a more literal message about the need to care for your body.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/intercourse\">Intercourse</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1504194569341-48a2e831a3a7?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxJbnRlcmNvdXJzZXxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"A man and woman cuddling together in bed.\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@beccatapert?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Becca Tapert</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><div><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Since dreams allow for the free exploration of feelings, it is common to dream of sharing affection, sex or intimacy with people other than your mate.

It can personify a type of guilt that has trapped your free expression. Visiting someone in jail can be a way of exploring what this person represents for you - an old partner can symbolize the power of self-acceptance you have given to them, which is currently restrained. A parent can personify self limiting ideas that you adopted from them. The jail suggests that some aspect of your free and self assured behavior is currently 'locked up.'</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/janitor\">Janitor</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1559308078-88465deb35cc?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxKYW5pdG9yfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"woman holding broom stick during daytime\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ashishjha?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Avinash Kumar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreaming of a janitor can represent an unwillingness to come clean and sort through issues that you consider painful.

Sometimes this type of dream reveals issues that you are <em>protecting</em>. For example, you may be protecting a precious jewel or <em>hiding</em> it from discovery. In this case, the dream shows defense mechanisms or unresolved issues that you have hidden away. The dream allows you to see how you have given something value (and protection) - when the issue really needs to be processed/released. Explore the surrounding symbolism to understand what it relates to: house/idea, car/motivation, garden/expression, road/goals. In some cases - the jewel represents self value and should be protected.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When you <em>find</em> a jewel - the dream is exploring how you might discover your own value - how you explore unknown potential or how you can recognize self worth by doing a little digging. When the jewel is associated with something you <em>wear</em> - such as jewelry - the idea of value and protection relate to the part of the body that is adorned. For example - a dream that focuses on earrings (ear) can be coaching you to listen more - a bracelet can have a message about giving and taking (hand/wrist) or providing for yourself. The bracelet can also have associations with being held back (restrained) because of values or priorities that are not healthy. A necklace can represent your core identity although it also covers the heart, which can be good or bad. The necklace can also have associations with responsibilities because it is 'worn around the neck.' While the jewel represents what you hold to be valuable - how it appears in a dream will describe its positive and/or negative meaning.

Clues to how you can solve a crisis however, will come through in the interesting ways the work environment appears <em>different</em>. For example a dream of being at work that focuses on the ceiling - can be exploring your feelings about the 'ceiling' placed on your upward mobility. The telephone can symbolize communication issues. Weird things on the walls or strange walls can symbolize your self-imposed limitations or the 'ideal' you work to achieve and whether or not it is a good fit for you (pictures). The carpet can symbolize issues you are not facing. Unusual wall colors can be explored in terms of what the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong>colors</strong></a> represent. Even your fellow employees can represent aspects that you attribute to them, as you explore adopting or discarding these traits.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/jockey\">Jockey</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1580974582235-4996ef109bbe?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxKb2NrZXl8ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"man riding horse statue during daytime\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@museumsvictoria?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Museums Victoria</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">This character is responsible for controlling how a horse behaves and the horse often personifies the spirit.

Whether or not you understand astrology, the planet seems to emanate abundance because perhaps, of its size.

In the dream, it appeared perfectly natural for the characters to ignore the law. Nature is blind to the idea of justice. There is only a movement toward balance and regeneration. Justice is a man-made illusion and since the dreamscape seems to have a more organic basis, it seeks only to ‘’work through’ the things that block you in your growth. A court room dream can suggest bringing different aspects up for review in order to find balance. Something bad going on in a dream that nobody seems aware of, can also represent knowing, at some level, that you are doing something that undermines your wellness.

Just as the kite relies on the wind to keep it aloft - the message can be about moving with the changes while remaining open to opportunity.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/kittens\">Kittens</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1582461198261-b655abb99f81?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxLaXR0ZW5zfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"brown and white tabby cat lying on green grass\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@kelvinyup?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Kelvin Yup</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Seeing many kittens in a dream can symbolize innocence and the birth of your intuition.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/kneeling\">Kneeling</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598629978663-1e59ce59de90?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxLbmVlbGluZ3xlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"silhouette of woman sitting on floor\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@guitarist321?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Chris Ainsworth</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">To dream of kneeling shows a movement toward humility.

The setting can offer messages related to: how you are seeing clearly in the <strong><em>Day</em></strong> (consciously) or you may use a <strong><em>Light</em></strong> (exploring hidden aspects) or whether you are not facing something in the <strong><em>Night</em></strong> or in the <strong><em>Dark</em></strong> (something that is unconscious or unrecognized.) Noon has associations with midlife and turning points. You can understand the hours as a snapshot of life stages. Being late can represent feeling that you are 'running behind' what you thought you might achieve at this point in your life.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">In a <strong><em>cityscape</em></strong>, you are exploring social exchanges or changes in work. Often you will explore half built <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/houses-and-buildings\"><strong><em>structures </em></strong></a>with unusual construction as the setting personifies ideas within that are being renovated and redefined. Shops and markets are a way of exploring your identity and the idea of self-value. You can search through <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/clothing-and-makeup\"><strong><em>clothes</em></strong></a> when you are making changes to your identity or persona. Themes of getting back change from a clerk can represent these 'changes' and the idea of making a valuable contribution in what you do. Explore the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/numbers\"><strong><em>numbers</em></strong></a> associated with the change you receive for further insight.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">In the <strong><em>forest</em></strong> (subconscious,) you often meet the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/archetypes-and-universal-characters\"><strong>Characters</strong></a> or guide who can offer clues to your transformative journey. Approaching the forest, which grows from the roots of your beliefs will always represent your attempt to overcome fear and unmask your greater power. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/tree\"><strong><em>Trees</em></strong></a> are stationary and rooted, suggesting the wealth of your family heritage. The <strong><em>jungle</em></strong> is that place within that remains uncivilized. Often you will dream of jungle patterns as decorations in a house as a way of exploring these natural and organic aspects of yourself. You climb <strong><em>mountains</em></strong> to gain a wider view, while the mountain can also represent how you can remain a prisoner of your beliefs. The <strong><em>desert</em></strong> returns you to an uncomplicated or <strong><em>barren landscape </em></strong>where you can discover the real roots of your sustenance.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams about <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/water\"><strong><em>water</em></strong></a> occur commonly because water represents your emotions, and how you feel about the changes that you face as you move through life. To dream of <strong><em>turbulent water </em></strong>suggests a sense of emotional crisis associated with moving forward. Any time this type of dream occurs, later, you may dream about being on a similar ship and crossing the water that has become calm. This is representative of the emotional growth that you have achieved. In all of our ancient stories, water is the mysterious reservoir where the hero is to retrieve a treasure. Similarly, <strong><em>raging water </em></strong>often initiates you into a process of self-discovery. <strong><em>Floods</em></strong> and <strong><em>tsunamis</em></strong> demonstrate how emotions break free to undermine the foundation of your beliefs until you are forced to let go. What you thought was solid and what you thought you needed, is washed away as you pursue the basics of survival (well-being.) Water can also represent health and wellness since it is a symbol of the elixir of life.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The <strong><em>Great Sea,</em></strong> ocean and beach are a classic symbol of exploring the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong><em>unconscious</em></strong></a> or awakening to hidden aspects within.

In a sense you are looking through the ideas you have placed on the shelf, revisiting them to see what is necessary for the future and what should be discarded. If you are looking through books with the parent or in relation to the parent, you are examining their influences on your thinking. Seeing something in writing is often the first step in integrating a new idea into consciousness. The type of book will give you an idea of what part of your thinking is changing.

A light shows the movement of ideas into conscious awareness. The light makes the less visible more visible, suggesting your attempt to become more aware. Symbols related to the light portray your attitude about seeing what they represent more clearly. Light surrounding another object can tie it to your spiritual path. For example, a glowing triangle can be a way of acknowledging spiritual insight with body, mind and spirit. A Ram illuminated in a glowing fire can symbolize spiritual perseverance.

Misplacing an item reveals your current insecurities surrounding what the symbol represents. If it is a purse or wallet, it can suggest financial insecurities. Looking for an heirloom or family treasure can signify your insecurities about your chance to pro-create. Searching for clothing can symbolize exploring a new identity, while searching for lost baggage can portray the idea that an old identity is no longer serving you. Searching is a theme when you are not acknowledging how you may be feeling unfulfilled in the present.

To dream of winning the lottery however, places the result of what you experience on others, fate or the outside and unpredictable forces around you.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">On one hand, dreaming of winning the lottery shows that you want to win or succeed - or <em>get a lucky break</em>. You can think of winning as giving you the opportunity to experience a sense of 'arrival.' It lifts you above all of your hard effort when you are too focused on the work - and not enough on the reward, or where the work may be leading you. It allows you to re-examine what you value in a way that might change your direction or focus.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Since dreams offer clues about how we can be more fulfilled, and we dream about what we are not facing - the lottery can suggest the need to take action or responsibility to claim your prize (fulfillment). For example, rather than succeed by 'the luck of the draw' explore whether you have a clear vision of what you want - the lottery can indicate how something fulfilling is within your reach - but you may be working so hard you are missing it.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As a symbol of balancing desires against experience - you may be taking responsibility for your success and blaming outside influences when you fail. An inconsistency in your thinking can undermine fulfillment. The idea of a lottery is showing how you are not owning your accomplishments or seeing how failure is not punishment - but often a way of honing your continual success. The message coaches you to connect the outcome - to what you want, or what you are doing. If a specific number(s) was tied to winning - it should be explored as an aspect that is missing in your equation of fulfillment.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/love\">Love</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606787364397-a9c1d754a531?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MXwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxMb3ZlfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"man and woman sitting at table with foods\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@jimmydean?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Jimmy Dean</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><div><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Love is a complex idea in the dreamscape because dreams are portraying <em>inner</em> dynamics.

Consciously you may feel that you are functioning independently in a current relationship, but since you dream of what you are not facing, the appearance of an 'old flame' can be activated when you feel uncertain about your value in a current relationship. These past partners embody the idea of self love - they appear as we explore and merge (sexual intimacy) with this potential to love ourselves. This must occur independently from the feedback we are currently receiving.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">All types of characters can appear in dreams in which you have a strong sense of attraction. Consider the adjective you would use to describe this person - or what they portray as a representation of you. A woman in a man's dream can portray the budding of his sensitivity - while the man in a woman's dream can portray her ability to be powerful and provide for herself. The attraction becomes symbolic of bringing some part of your own potential forward for exploration and integration. Intercourse symbolizes the merging.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The desire to be loved and accepted is a strong motivating force in life. When you dream that your love is rejected -you may be rejecting the idea of self love. Dreams are always a wake up call to be authentic, fulfilled and independent. Through the development of self love - you grow strong enough so that nothing anyone says or does can make or break your day.

The situation surrounding the luggage will reveal what you are 'carrying with you.' In many cases, the luggage is lost as you become more open to the idea that you are carrying unnecessary baggage. If someone else is bringing your luggage in a dream, they may have a strong influence on your sense of identity. If the luggage is associated with wrinkled or dirty clothes, you may have feelings of unworthiness that while carried with you, are being examined in preparation for release. If the luggage is associated with regal or formal clothing, your sense of self esteem is being examined. If the luggage reveals an unusual or inappropriate type of clothing, you may be opening to unexplored potential as your identity is undergoing transformation. Whatever is revealed when you open the luggage provides clues to the ideas that you are exploring. See also <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\"\n",

This can hold the idea of communication with others and also, communication from within - as in intuition or inner guidance. If you receive bizarre mail from someone you do not know, the message can be about inner guidance as you open to unexplored ideas. Receiving or sending something in the mail (as opposed to a phone call) can portray issues related to agreements and the idea that what you are saying or hearing might be inspected more carefully because you may be jumping to conclusions. The slowness and dependence on others to deliver what we send through the mail can portray how 'lines get crossed' or how some part of us (<a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/defense-mechanisms\"><strong>defense mechanisms</strong></a>) can undermine clear communication with others.

Many times a dream that focuses on makeup has a message that relates to not expressing yourself authentically. You may be in a job that is not appropriate or that does not allow you to express your talents and real capabilities. If you are wearing heavier than normal makeup on the eyes - you may be exploring your ability to see yourself more clearly - or to give definition to your soul expression. If the dream focuses on lipstick, the message can relate to covering up expression in terms of what you say. Red lipstick that accentuates the mouth can be a message about 'speaking' what you are passionate about. If your cheeks are accentuated, you may need to open to intimacy or feelings that allow you to feel 'in the pink.' If you are going somewhere and realize that you have forgotten your makeup, the dream can be coaching you to move forward in a different way that better expresses who you really are.

For a man, these symbols can signify his vital essence or life force. He may dream of his penis as a way of exploring sexual drives or the need to activate his passion. For a woman, she may be activating power or need to assert herself with a more masculine approach. If the genitals are deformed or unusual, the dream can be coaching you to connect with your power in a more functional and less subterranean way. For a woman, if this type of dream appears threatening - she may not be comfortable expressing assertiveness and independence. Since ancient times, phallic symbols have portrayed dominating power and the life force that asserts, protects and defends. Since we generally dream about what we are not expressing or facing, this type of dream can be coaching your ability to become more empowered and passionate.

You can understand the Martyr or symbol sacrificed as representing some aspect of you. If you dream of persecution or being punished for your beliefs, you might explore the severity of your own inner critic. To dream of someone being crucified can represent unprocessed guilt or anger and how self defeating thoughts stunt fulfillment. To dream of a hanging ties the message more to feeling\n",
    "trapped, an inability to communicate and the inability to breathe freely. In a sense, the weight of your own body is pulling you down. This type of dream often occurs when a child held the caregiver in contempt. They may have felt crucified or unjustly punished. Some aspect of the parent can still influence their beliefs and at some level, we do identify with our parents. The conflict created by believing consciously that one <em>is nothing like</em> the parent, while unconsciously knowing <em>they are </em>the offspring can create unprocessed guilt and self-punishing behavior. One may say they have no guilt but if they explore whether they feel like an outsider or unworthy, they can begin to understand the nature of unprocessed guilt. Being crucified or hung appears as the dream setting specifically because the ritualistic sacrifice of the authentic self is unacknowledged in daily life. The critical tapes of being unworthy heard as a child 'pull on us' and can 'tug us down.' The best medicine for a difficult childhood is forgiveness.

Since we dream of what we are not allowing into consciousness, dreaming of money can represent the part of you that is traded or bartered for acceptance, where the dream suggests a type of self worth that is undermined through conformity. While money has a high level of focus during daily life, in dreams, it often symbolizes ‘false’ values that gratify you in the short term, but leave you unfulfilled. Searching for money shows your desire to connect with a stronger sense of self-worth. At the same time, if you are dreaming of money, then you may be neglecting or not facing financial issues.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/monkey\">Monkey</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1540573133985-87b6da6d54a9?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxNb25rZXl8ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"brown coated monkey on branch\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@haughters?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Jamie Haughton</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A monkey is a playful primate that appears to have no sense of discipline.

A monster can appear in a dream as a representation of <em>your power </em>and how you may find this power frightening. Dream images can take on a <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/shadow\"><strong>Shadow </strong></a>form because we are unwilling to face something difficult or painful. For example, a person who was labeled a black sheep or 'a difficult child' can have two personas active: they can be a successful achiever by day but have unresolved tapes from childhood that undermine their sense of self acceptance or self worth. They may dream of a stalker trying to 'break into their house' (integration with Self) as a representation of this 'vagabond' identity and the need to understand, integrate it and 'let it in.'</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A Dracula character can be a way of exploring how what your are doing might 'vampire' or deplete another area of your life because you are overly focusing on one thing. A Frankenstein character can represent moving through life without heart or sensation. The devil can personify being depressed or giving up on the goodness of life and feeling guilty about doing so or being unwilling to face depression. The monster is portraying you in some way.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Explore first the symbolism represented by the monster and observe how it might symbolize an aspect of you. The energy only appears as a monster because it has lived in the shadows for so long. In all cases, monster dreams should be viewed as a call to confront what you have hidden away. There is nothing negative taking place - it is an initiation that can lead to authentic power and increased self knowledge.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The monster can also represent what feels beyond your ability to manage such as: your temper or anger. The monster can be a way of releasing feelings that are considered 'unsavory' by day. A woman approaching menopause may feel her body doing things that seem beyond her power to control and she may dream of a monster kissing her as she attempts to integrate and understand the changes her body holds over her. At menopause stages particularly - the monster will have more of an association with being more male than female. For a man who is not owning up to outbursts, he may dream of a monster or unsavory character stalking him. In all cases the 'bad and frightening thing' is merely representing aspects of you that are not integrated. This monster can also portray a type of power that once understood, can lead to greater empowerment and fulfillment.

As you go though major changes, you must allow outworn aspects to 'pass on,' as part of your identity of the past may need to 'die away.' At the same time, being pursued by a murderer can portray one aspect attempting to kill off another, not always beneficial and so the symbolism surrounding the murder needs to be explored. If someone is 'assassinated' then you must consider whether you are doing something that is, perhaps, assassinating <em>your</em> character.

As you move toward intimacy, you may have dreams of being undressed in public or relieving yourself in bathrooms without walls as the result of having your nakedness exposed. As a child, you may have dreamt of going to school in your underwear when what you most wanted was to abide by the golden rule. In proportion to the rules you impose on yourself, you will find that dreams lead you toward the freedom to be yourself. To ‘get naked’ or relieve yourself of your outer covering, you are allowing for the movement of other aspects of the psyche that had not previously found expression. This sense of being vulnerable, suggests how intimacy and exposing yourself is the only way of empowering authenticity.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Being exposed can also take place in dreams in which you feel trapped or frightened. Since the dream is bringing all that you fear to the surface, the symbolism should be given careful consideration so that you can transform the energy of fear into authentic empowerment. If the dream focuses on a snake, you might shed your skin and learn to express your natural drives; if it is an intruder, then you might try facing intimacy without feeling like others are intruding. When some part of you is being revealed, stalked and discarded or killed, you ‘get naked,’ confront the truth of what you fail to understand about yourself and learn to ‘let what is unnecessary go.’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams usually reveal the exact opposite of what you believe to be true about yourself. When you are frightened, it is a call to overcome your fear of being natural. If you feel ashamed, you may need to overcome shame to exist as a natural creature in a natural world.

Your name is the ‘identity’ that you have had your entire life. If you are trying to be someone that you are not, the name can bring that message home. Hearing a bizarre name in a dream happens when you are adopting new ways of interacting and experiencing life. This name is a ‘label’ for the emerging side of you that has yet to be processed and integrated. It is common for the psyche to use a name cryptically and humorously as a way of exploring inconsistencies or unacknowledged issues. Approach the name objectively and explore it in the internet.

Since it covers the heart, it is a symbol of self acceptance and the discovery/commitment to inner beauty. In some cases, since it is worn around the neck, the necklace can have associations with being yoked by responsibilities. If the necklace is broken or lost, you may be coming to terms with letting go of something you have been committed to.

The message can be about overcoming confusion and the need to focus in order to 'sew' the seeds of success. If the needle pierces the skin, it indicates the need to allow your feelings and emotions to come to 'skin awareness.' It draws blood at the same time that it causes pain. Both ideas are associated with the activation of feelings. You may feel that opening to intimacy is painful, but being injected with a needle suggests the necessary healing that will allow you to move on. Threading a sewing needle is a symbol of creating a new identity.

Seeing it ‘advertised’ for public view, is often the first step in owning up to what you would rather not face. Whatever ‘has been published’ needs to find its way into waking consciousness.

When we are not open to change, or unwilling to acknowledge being in a rut, dreams often get extremely <em>colorful</em>. In an effort to get our attention, they can appear quite frightening. Nightmares are actually a good sign that something powerful is stirring within. Since we dream of what we are not facing, nightmares are a wake up call to take stock of what is blocking your growth and authenticity. Sometimes you may refuse to acknowledge that ‘you are on the wrong path,’ and often nightmares will recur until changes are made and the situation is resolved. It can be as simple as ‘leaving something behind’ while you hurry to your destination or as frightening as actually experiencing <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/death\"><strong>death</strong></a> or dismemberment. More than any other dream, the nightmare will disturb you so profoundly, that rather than run, you are forced to confront the truth. This is its simple goal: overcome your fear by seeing how ‘unreasonable’ it is. Once this fearful aspect that you are not facing is integrated, the nightmare will not recur.

Dreaming of the number 9 can symbolize the Archetype of the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/magician\"><strong>Magician</strong></a> - or the profound ability to use what is at your disposal to achieve what you think is not possible. The cat has 'nine lives' to suggest how 9 symbolizes potential in the face of what appears to be an impasse. As the highest single digit number - and ideas like 'to the ninth degree,' dreaming of 9 can show completion or situations reaching an apex. In numerology it is the representation of a highly evolved spiritual awareness that points toward humanitarianism or a focus that transcends the sense of Self.

They can have universal meanings from sayings: <em>threes a crowd</em>; <em>seventh heaven</em>; or the <em>ninth degree. </em>They can also have personal meaning based on your past or actual experience. If numbers appear in relation to time, they can be exploring where you stand in relation to life stages. Numbers related to times of day can appear as morning (representing beginnings) afternoon (apexes or turning points) and evening (endings.)</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Explore the numbers objectively. For example: 3:15 can represent a need for (3) integration - (1) that involves the self - and (5) parenting/nurturing others. Dreaming of 719 can suggest how (7) fate - often leads you (1) backward or back to the self - before you can achieve (9) actualization. Life is often a circular journey. If you add the numbers together, they can also offer a messages where 3+1+5 = 8, or organization and patience. Sometimes numbers are prophetic and pertain to how issues will be resolved in terms of months or days.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/zero\"><strong><em>Zero</em></strong></a> and <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/eight\"><strong><em>eight</em></strong></a> often suggest wholeness and infinity because both appear endless. Like the circle or mandala, zero can be a composition of the Self as it moves toward wholeness. Round <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/shapes\"><strong>shapes</strong></a> are often a message about taking a more holistic perspective that is more inclusive and less self centered. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/one\"><strong><em>One</em></strong></a> suggests aloneness or self-sufficiency; <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/two\"><strong><em>Two</em></strong></a> depicts partnerships, choices and integration; <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/three\"><strong><em>Three</em></strong></a> can represent difficulty that requires integration, in the sense of a triangle situation, which demands resolution so balance can be achieved. It can also suggest getting the ‘third degree’ or ‘threes a crowd;’ <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/four\"><strong><em>Four</em></strong></a>can symbolize getting grounded; luck as in four leaf clovers, a symbol of the earth and elements; stability, as in ‘four on the floor’ or crouching prior to moving forward. It is often a symbol that appears when you are getting grounded, more earthy in your approach or seeking balance. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/five\"><strong><em>Five</em></strong></a> can be associated with family, and represent fertility, abundance, and parenting. Like the digits of the hands and feet, issues related to taking, giving, holding and sustenance can be explored through the number five.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/six\"><strong><em>Six</em></strong></a> can be a way of getting the idea of ‘sex’ out in the open or it can have mysterious or spiritual/psychic associations as in the case of extra sensory perception. Often dreams of the number six can be a message about going beyond the senses or routine observation. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/seven\"><strong><em>Seven</em></strong></a>is associated with religion and stages or cycles in life. It can symbolize luck and reward as in experiencing <strong><em>seventh heaven</em></strong>. Seven also appears as a representation of fate or simply relying on opportunity rather than making concrete decisions.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Eight</em></strong> can represent infinity, eternity or wholeness, but it is also a symbol of evolution. Eight is a powerful number that can signify patience. organization and leadership.\n",
    "Words that are <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/homonyms\"><strong>Homonyms</strong></a> (like eight/ate or six/sex) are the psyche’s clever tools for slipping ideas past consciousness. In light of this, <strong><em>eight</em></strong> must also be considered in relation to <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/food\"><strong>Food</strong></a> and nourishment. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/nine\"><strong><em>Nine</em></strong></a> is usually associated with a turning point or apex; being at the end of our rope as in ‘nine lives’ or 911. But nine can also symbolize opportunities being missed by not challenging yourself. It can signify excess or perfection since it is associated with ‘<em>being dressed to the nines</em>.’ Nine is also a number associated with a more humanitarian perspective and the idea of higher thought or philosophy.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/ten\"><strong><em>Ten</em></strong></a> can signify ambition because of its association with completion and arrival. It is a sense of having it all and integrating family and work in productive ways. You can dream of something related to the <strong><em>eleventh</em></strong> hour or it can be the non-integrated idea of one against one; <strong><em>Twelve</em></strong>, as in months, becomes completion or the beginning of a new cycle; <strong><em>Thirteen</em></strong> is odd, unnatural or unlucky and must also be considered in terms of integrating one (self) and three (eliminating or choosing.)</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Numbers can be associated with personal experience, age or they can also be reduced to units. <strong><em>Fourteen</em></strong>, as one and four suggests how your idea of independence (one), is currently challenged by issues of balance (four.) <strong><em>Twenty-five </em></strong>becomes two and five, and can signify how partnership (two) leads to fertility or issues about giving and taking (five.) <strong><em>Forty-six </em></strong>would be a message about stability (four) as you approach sex or increased ‘senses,’ or sensuality (six.)</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">If you are searching career direction - numbers can be associated with certain areas. For example <strong>One</strong> can represent an entrepreneurial approach; <strong>Two</strong> can suggest work that relates to managing money or that utilizes the senses. <strong>Three</strong> can symbolize communication and marketing; <strong>Four </strong>can relate to the home or real estate; <strong>Five</strong> the arts; <strong>Six</strong> health and hygiene; <strong>Seven</strong> fashion and relationships; <strong>Eight</strong> big business and the stock market; <strong>Nine </strong>law and politics; <strong>Ten</strong> public relations; <strong>Eleven </strong>science or humanitarian work and <strong>Twelve</strong> can represent hospitals and public service.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/nun\">Nun</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1527235882674-8f8b0f7102dd?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxOdW58ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"policeman assist a nun\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@koutchinski?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Felix Koutchinski</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">For a woman, the nun can represent a sense of protecting or covering sexuality in light of spiritual beliefs.

These aroma circuits or odor pathways are believed to have become the neural outline of the limbic system within the mammalian area. This is the emotional center that generates the parental care of mammals: playfulness, vocal calling and emotion. Emotion and mood originally evolved from neural structures, once allocated only to the sense of smell that merely attracted or repelled. Over time, these two simple responses became the complicated emotions we experience today.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams that focus on an odor may arouse either a positive or negative response. The situation is ‘visible’ only to the nose. ‘Something doesn’t smell right’ when you know it is bad, or ‘the odor may be pleasing’ and attract you when it is good. The other symbolism can shed light on what you are ‘sensing’ with your nose that you are perhaps not able to see. Attempting to cover body odor can signify hiding natural urges or sexuality from others.<br></p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/office\">Office</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1564069114553-7215e1ff1890?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxPZmZpY2V8ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"person sitting beside table\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rozetsky?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Ant Rozetsky</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams that take place in the office are generally exploring work issues when you are wanting more in your career. All the little nuances of the office can provide direction about what is holding you back or what you can do to achieve your aspirations. Items hung on the walls portray beliefs and allow you to see the ideas that you 'surround yourself with.' Computers can reveal thought patterns and phones can symbolize communication. Focusing on the ceiling can portray what you believe are limitations to your growth and upward mobility. Going to the roof can show how you are exploring a new direction outside of your current work scenario. The rug or carpet can symbolize issues 'swept under the carpet' or what is at the foundation of the situation. Windows and doors allow you to explore new opportunities and their condition can show whether you are doing so. The desk is a symbol of being driven by a need for security. If you open the desk to find something unusual, you are exploring other talents or inner resources at your disposal.

The dream can be exploring intuition or a type of wisdom that might be activated in your work. The brown owl can relate to work that is practical, earthy or grounded, while the white owl can suggest healing work or spiritual aspirations. This nocturnal bird can also relate to messages coming from the unconscious. If the owl attacks or threatens you, the message can be about how your outlook or self righteousness is not working for you - or is alienating you from others.

In a sense, your forward movement is on hold. Cars represent motivation and how you are moving forward. When the car is parked, it is either because you are taking time to re-evaluate where you are going or are unaware of issues that are undermining your ability to go forward. Looking for your car in a parking garage often occurs when you are exploring a new direction. A collision in a parking lot can occur when two areas of your life are out of balance.

What can make dream interpretation confusing is the inability to understand how dreaming of others allows you to explore the traits you associate with them.

When you look at the dream as a plot where all of the characters are representing you, look beyond the character and ask: <em>what word would I use to describe this person?

A <strong><em>female appearing in a male’s dream </em></strong>will represent his intuitive and sensitive side (see <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/anima-animus\"><strong>Anima</strong></a>). <strong><em>Kissing</em></strong> these characters will reflect how you are exploring and integrating what they represent. Kissing is the first stage in integration where sexual consummation shows full integration. When there is <strong><em>attraction and rejection </em></strong>involved it reveals your desire or fear/inability to adopt these traits. Even spouses can become a representation of the Anima and Animus, or a type of role model quality that portrays what we are exploring and adopting. When we are in a relationship and dream of our partner behaving in a negative way, we are exploring the power they hold over us <em>because we give them that power</em>. In this way, <strong><em>negative or frightening characters </em></strong>can represent the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/shadow\"><strong>Shadow</strong></a>, or that part of our power and authenticity that we are 'disowning' and therefore, it stalks us as the energy seeks expression and integration.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/attack-or-being-chased\"><strong><em>Running away from unknown attackers </em></strong></a>suggests how you can feel ‘pursued’ by non-integrated aspects as you grow and evolve. The times when you are growing the most will be associated with these types of dreams because you are experimenting with ‘new’ ways of interacting with the people around you.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>People from the past </em></strong>can represent you at that point in life, and <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/family\"><strong><em>family members </em></strong></a>usually appear in a dream that is helping you to understand how a current crisis was created through personal dynamics of childhood.

They negotiate important aspects of your unique needs against the consensus or ‘older members’ of the group. A <strong><em>teacher</em></strong> can represent wisdom from your <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/wise-man-and-woman\"><strong><em>Higher Self </em></strong></a>and often older persons, like <strong><em>grandparents</em></strong> can represent the guiding and wise side of you coming into awareness.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Famous people </em></strong>can symbolize archetypes as you explore your associations with what these people represent. They stand as icons or display characteristics and potentials that you are adopting or exploring. <strong><em>Comedians</em></strong> can offer a message about the need to ‘lighten up.’ In a situation, you may find that you will achieve more if you can be less serious. The issues surrounding dreams of this type suggest that you are ‘trying on this public identity’ in an effort to gain esteem or approval. Just like any other character however, the word you would use to describe them will shed light on this part of you that you are exploring. Ask yourself: ‘<em>what is this famous person known for’ </em>in order to understand the part of you that the dream is exploring.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Dreaming of people with transgender</em></strong> traits like men with breasts or women with beards can represent how you are exploring and integrating sensitivity and assertiveness.

Carl Jung believed that dreaming was a way of compensating for the \"one-sided\" attitude that is often held in waking consciousness. Dreaming of sorting through old clothing can signify sorting through old ways of expressing yourself as you change and grow. Dreaming of packing clothing can symbolize the way you hold to just one way of expressing yourself. Often you will not be able to find\n",

Dogs relate to unconditional love but if you are afraid of a dog in a dream, you may not be feeling trusting in your current relationship. The cat remains aloof and can symbolize a desire to be more self sufficient. Animals usually portray more natural or organic drives and passions - and when it is domesticated it can embody trading natural expression for security needs. Explore what type of animal is being portrayed as a pet for more information of the side of you that may be in need of freedom or nurturing.

To move into a position that <strong><em>places you above\n",
    "</em></strong>or higher than something, portrays your attempt to ‘rise above’ it. Whatever is <strong>beside</strong> another symbol in a dream suggests some sort of connection between them; while something at the <strong><em>center</em></strong> represents the cause or how it affects you to the core or the root of an issue.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">What is <strong><em>behind</em></strong> you represents the past and circumstances that have passed, while it can also mean turning your back on what is important in a way that it stalks or shadows you. What is in <strong><em>front </em></strong>of you often suggests the direction in which you are going, or what you need to face, while something described as being <strong><em>before you</em></strong>, suggests that it may be blocking your movement. Something <strong><em>next</em></strong> to you or <strong><em>near</em></strong> you makes the symbol important, although you have not ‘owned’ or integrated it. A symbol that is associated with being to the <strong><em>right</em></strong> can represent behavior that is correct or acceptable, while the <strong><em>left </em></strong>shows deviation from the norm and a movement toward authenticity.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Descending</em></strong> or going down can represent getting more grounded or returning to your roots. If you see something <strong><em>beneath the water </em></strong>or <strong><em>lower on a hill</em></strong>, it is sometimes indicative of bringing the relevance of this symbol to the surface, like ‘below the belt’ can mean sexual feelings. Seeing something <strong><em>up close</em></strong>, in <strong><em>daylight </em></strong>or under a <strong><em>light</em></strong> brings all that the symbol represents into a high level of focus and suggests that you are conscious of it. Issues that you are not facing will appear as symbolism viewed at <strong><em>night</em></strong>, in the <strong><em>dark,</em></strong> or appearing <strong><em>far away</em></strong>. The low level of light suggests not recognizing its importance and so, it remains ‘out of the reach’ of consciousness. Imagery that is associated with being <strong><em>deep</em></strong> portrays your sense of exploring the deeper aspects of the symbolism, while appearing <strong><em>shallow</em></strong> has the opposite meaning, in the sense of its irrelevance or the need to release it.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/plant\">Plant</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1553530979-7ee52a2670c4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MXwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxQbGFudHxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"Two Boxed Water cartons on a white surface\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@boxedwater?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Boxed Water Is Better</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The plant is similar to the symbolism of the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/garden\"><strong>Garden </strong></a>and <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/tree\"><strong>Tree</strong></a>.

Plucking your eyebrows represents changes you are making in perception and expression.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/plumbing\">Plumbing</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1538474705339-e87de81450e8?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxQbHVtYmluZ3xlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"grayscale photography of metal pipes\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@samthewam24?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Samuel Sianipar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When you dream of faulty plumbing, there is a sense that your emotions have become uncontrollable.

Generally a pot is used to cook liquids and so the association leans more toward feelings. The idea of simmering and boiling are also associated with emotions - you may or may not be aware of feeling angry or resentful and the dream can be bringing this to your attention. If you discover a pot of gold, you are examining latent talents or moving toward a greater level of Self sufficiency. Pottery can have associations with the past, as something buried but discovered for its importance in the present. In this type of dream, you are resurrecting old issues so that you can find the hidden value of what you learned.

Explore the symbol that is portrayed as the prize for clues about how you are currently approaching ambition. A prize or treasure emphasizes a goal or something that is an important aspect of your fulfillment. Discovering treasure or something buried usually has associations with what is repressed (guns/sex - gold/self-value.) We receive a prize usually because of our effort and tenacity. To dream of winning the lottery however, places the result of what you experience on others, fate or the outside and unpredictable forces around you.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">On one hand, dreaming of winning the lottery shows that you want to win or succeed - or <em>get a lucky break</em>. You can think of winning as giving you the opportunity to experience a sense of 'arrival.' It lifts you above all of your hard effort when you are too focused on the work - and not enough on the reward, or where the work may be leading you. It allows you to re-examine what you value in a way that might change your direction or focus.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Since dreams offer clues about how we can be more fulfilled, and we dream about what we are not facing - the lottery can suggest the need to take action or responsibility to claim your prize (fulfillment). For example, rather than succeed by 'the luck of the draw' explore whether you have a clear vision of what you want - the lottery can indicate how something fulfilling is within your reach - but you may be working so hard you are missing it.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As a symbol of balancing desires against experience - you may be taking responsibility for your success and blaming outside influences when you fail. An inconsistency in your thinking can undermine fulfillment. The idea of a lottery is showing how you are not owning your accomplishments or seeing how failure is not punishment - but often a way of honing your continual success. The message coaches you to connect the outcome - to what you want, or what you are doing. If a specific number(s) was tied to winning - it should be explored as an aspect that is missing in your equation of fulfillment.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/prophetic-dreams\">Prophetic Dreams</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1519214605650-76a613ee3245?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxQcm9waGV0aWMlMjBEcmVhbXN8ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\"\n",

This is exactly the interpretation of <em>why you dream. </em>When a dream is observed to ‘morph’ into different landscapes, you will find yourself describing the dream: <em>‘it seemed like the same dream, but…’</em> These dream cycles usually come in three parts and suggest:</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">a) you as ‘the hero’ and the current challenge that you face<br>b) the part the past played in creating the current circumstance, and<br>c) how you might discover the key to both, your real identity and destiny.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The first part describes the conflict at hand, while the second part will sometimes portray family members or symbolism from the past, describing how the current crisis was created. The third portion of the dream is often prophetic or when understood, will portray actual information that can be verified by future events.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The third setting (c) usually offers something that appears puzzling or strange. Its ‘newness’ or bizarre imagery often provides the most profound information about the ‘missing link’ in overcoming conflict or crisis. It will generally make more sense to you when you recognize how dreams have an uncanny way of getting the truth across in the most unusual ways. This third dream setting often provides images that can be observed as synchronistic or describing future events before they happen.

In this way, <strong><em>luggage</em></strong> can suggest baggage that needs to be released during a transformative process.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As the essence of the genetic traits that are bequeathed to your children, protected items, like <strong><em>jewels</em></strong> can represent responsibility or issues related to childbearing. Sometimes, protecting or looking for jewels or treasure can be a classic symbol of the healing that can take place after you discover what you are repressing; usually childhood pain. The <strong><em>purse</em></strong> and <strong><em>wallet </em></strong>portray your sense of self-worth and how protective you are of them will show how you protect who you are against who you might become. Changing careers often coincides with these types of symbols, where losing and searching for them is similar to searching for your new identity.

When we pull something, we feel responsible for carrying it with us. When we are forced to push, it shows a blockage. The extra energy required to push shows that something is not flowing easily. Sometimes pushing can be a message about the need for extra effort to succeed in some circumstance.

Its triangular face can represent the idea of three, or conflicting ideas that require integration. A triangle is also highly spiritual, so dreaming of a pyramid can portray the condition of your spiritual ideas and how you are blending material experiences with spiritual pursuits. Since it has four sides, it can also symbolize balance or issues that need to be brought together to achieve harmony.

The image of the Quaker related to the oat cereal brand can be a way of exploring why 'sowing your wild oats' may be under a type of 'house arrest' related to critical conscience. Another theme that the Quaker can personify is the 'quaking' or movement of urges that have been 'under wraps.'

While the dream has little to do with the actual idea that your health is threatened, the action of placing something in quarantine allows you to examine how you enact 'compulsory isolation' when you might find more happiness by opening up. You may not be giving free reign to your feelings. Dis-ease can objectify how you are feeling uneasy - or how you might release the tendency to hold back. When your feelings seem beyond your control - the idea of avoiding infection can symbolize your fear of 'affection' or <em>intimacy</em>. If you are being quarantined because you may be a threat to others - the dream can be suggesting that your behavior or thoughts are blocking your development. This type of dream can be a 'time out' while you re-examine unproductive thought patterns. You may also need to examine your self esteem to ensure that you are not harboring feelings of inadequacy.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/quarrel\">Quarrel</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1516544820488-4a99efa70a58?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxRdWFycmVsfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"two crane fighting while flying\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@chrissabor?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Chris Sabor</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">During the day we can meet people that challenge us through a type of conflict.

In the same way, characters that challenge you in a dream are attempting to bring something new into awareness. The particular character challenging you can represent a side of you that is undergoing exploration. Explore an adjective you would use to describe the person you are quarreling with in a dream. How does the character portray an aspect that you may be discarding, adopting or perhaps ignoring? The quarrel brings this issue forward for your consideration.

In fact, often you will wake up with words on your mind as the dream state changes into waking state. These words are capturing the dream imagery so stop and observe if you can see this happening upon waking. These words will sometimes become prophetic (capturing events that will unfold during the week) and is an interesting exercise that allows you to see how dreams have a different time sense.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When a question is asked of you in a dream - explore this question as if it is something your higher self is asking of you.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A good trick to enhance dream recall: use the state prior to waking to transfer the imagery in your dream into words. You dream in right brain holistic imagery yet usually awaken into left brain logic. The transition back to the left brain logical side can make the imagery evaporate. By transferring the images into words, you can then explore the symbols. You don't need to remember everything. You will generally dream of the same themes in different settings during the night.

If you are late for the test and therefore fail, your own insecurities are undermining your ability for success. A person doesn't succeed in life if they believe they will fail. Failure is a prerequisite for success. All accomplishments are achieved after a series of trials that include missing the mark. If you have suddenly forgotten what the material is about, you are being given the opportunity to let your old way of thinking go.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Being quizzed by an unusual character can also be the activation of the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/trickster\"><strong>Trickster</strong></a> archetype. You are tripped up in your inconsistencies of thought, so that you can start with a fresh perspective. The quiz measures what you know - and sometimes it is better not to know so that you can discover.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div></div></div></div>\n",

REM (rapid eye movement) proves everyone dreams. Sometimes we go through periods where we remember our dreams quite vividly. This usually correlates with periods of crisis. Dreams are changing us in profound ways <em>whether or not we remember them</em>...so remembering them doesn't appear important to how they affect us. Dreaming is like a digestive organ that assimilates, releases and helps us to process experience.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">However, enhancing your ability to remember your dreams does allow you to speed up your growth - because you are able to see the uncanny way some part of the mind seems to guide you - and you are able to work with the unconscious information consciously. It also allows you to see how dreaming has a different time sense that shows you how dreaming actually has prophetic information.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When we dream we are using a part of the brain that developed before language. We sometimes think of the left side of the brain as being associated with language and logic, and the right side associated with a holistic awareness, responding more to images. CAT and PET scans of the dreaming brain however, show that many parts of the brain are active during dreaming. The sections that are inactive keep us from acting out our dreams. The limbic/emotional region is highly active during dreaming.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">At the same time, it seems that switching between the image driven/dreaming brain that responds emotionally to the imagery - isn't the 'same brain' that wakes up and begins rationalizing and planning the day's routine. Many people have been able to increase their ability for dream recall using the following technique:</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Teach\n",
    "yourself to wake up more slowly. Don't be quick to jump into the day's routine with your mind. Keep a diary by your bed to record your images before they slip from your mind. While still in the 'dream state' think of one or two words that capture what you were just experiencing in the dream. You will be amazed at how things will happen during the week that have those words as a theme.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">It is not important to remember everything, because through the night the same message can be repeated in several themes. Note some of the symbols that were in the dream and explore what part of your life is undergoing scrutiny.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/renovate\">Renovate</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1517581177682-a085bb7ffb15?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxSZW5vdmF0ZXxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"man climbing on ladder inside room\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mimithekuk?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Milivoj Kuhar</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Buildings symbolize aspects of our inner architecture.

We may remodel the kitchen when we are making changes to how we move toward greater fulfillment. We can renovate a bathroom as a way of 'coming clean' of self-defeating behavior or fears of intimacy. If we renovate the bedroom, we can be making changes to how we approach sex or changes to our beliefs as in 'we made the bed we lie in.'

Our most ancient evolutionary processes are captured by the image of reptiles.

As one of the oldest and most durable creatures, dreaming of lizards, salamanders or iguanas can portray the power of your survival instincts, both good and bad. In some cases, the message can be coaching you toward self preservation but more often than not, dreams of these creatures can embody the need to examine self destructive tendencies. Dreams of reptiles related to water can symbolize movement within the unconscious as something comes to the surface to reveal the power of your biological drives like anxiety and sexual impulses. As a symbol of transformation or how you can learn to shed 'your old skin' reptiles often have a message related to letting go of a dysfunctional approach to anxiety.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">On a grand scale, the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/dragon\"><strong>Dragon</strong></a>is a symbol of metamorphosis and empowerment. <strong><em>Snakes</em></strong> can have sexual meanings, although their ability to renew their ‘protective covering’ suggests transformative aspects currently taking place. They can also represent the biting or poisonous side of your instinctual nature, which you try to repress, and thus, it recoils to 'hurt you.'</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Unlike warm blooded and emotionally reactive mammals, reptiles are associated with being cold blooded and seeking protection. The <strong><em>turtle</em></strong> can portray covering your feelings or insecurities when you are hurt or feeling shy. How big (<strong><em>dinosaur/dragon</em></strong>) or self-destructive they appear will suggest the level of repression as your unconscious processes seek wellness and expression. Their vigilant behavior and ancient associations with transformation will portray your physical well being and bio-physical processes. When a <strong><em>reptile is injured </em></strong>in a dream, it can portray how your defensive mechanisms are actually hurting you.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Alligators</em></strong> and <strong><em>Crocodiles</em></strong> move below the surface, but are carnivorous, and suggest something painful stirring beneath the waters of the unconscious that can <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/bite\"><strong>Bite</strong></a> you to draw <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/blood\"><strong>Blood</strong></a> or allow you to feel.

We can take unusual things out of the refrigerator as a way of no longer keeping old issues 'on ice.'</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The living room is where we explore how we bring others into our sense of intimacy. The office is usually work related. We might explore the ceiling or climb to the roof when we are ready to expand our capabilities.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Hallways represent transitions and appear when we are making changes. The windows and doors can symbolize how we meet opportunity or move to expand our perspective. If we are unable to 'see out' or 'open' the door - the message can show us what we fear. The stairs can represent going up in terms of aspirations, or going down to explore what we store in the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>subconscious</strong></a> area of the mind. The <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/attic\"><strong>attic</strong></a> can symbolize spirituality or conscience, and the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/basement\"><strong>basement</strong></a> usually becomes thematic when we are digging below our habitual behavior during periods of intense transformation.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The bathroom appears when we are becoming more truthful with ourselves - we 'come clean.' The family room and hearth are classic symbols of family patterning. If a person other than a family member appears near the hearth, we may have adopted them in some way as a parent. The garage stores the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/vehicles-and-places-of-transportation\"><strong>car</strong></a>, so can appear when we are exploring our motivation or how we are moving forward in life.

The psyche is very 'economical' in how it can suggest two principles with one symbol: moving forward and the idea of personal effort. Because of its association with the arms, it can represent the idea of give and take as you move forward. At the same time, you must rely on the ‘current’ or be present enough to maximize your efforts. You may be questioning your ability to pull your own weight. Rowing can symbolize moving forward from a better sense of who you are and what you need in life.

Sand in an hourglass can suggest the passing of time and how you may feel that you are not achieving what you desire in terms of life stages. Sand at the seashore can represent nostalgia and aspirations or the feeling of ‘waiting for your ship to come in.’ Walking on sand, and making footprints along the water’s edge can symbolize your journey through life. When you are walking alone you may be exploring on a solo journey prior to making a change or when other footprints appear, you may be exploring partnership. The sandy shore of an ocean can also symbolize approaching the unconscious or exploring feelings that remain below the surface.

The word Lucifer meant Bearer of Light and in ancient times, was the name of Venus, the star that rose as the Morning or Evening Star. Lucifer is used only once in the book of Isaiah when he describes “Lucifer who has fallen.” Isaiah was writing about an historical and prideful Babylonian king, Tiglath Pilesar III. He used the word Lucifer to compare this arrogant king to the planet Venus, when it boldly rose before the sun in the morning.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As the Morning Star, Lucifer or Venus was always viewed as an imposter of the sun. Because of mistranslations, we have a mythical symbol that gives us permission to remain victims. Yet, our dreams reveal how light always overcomes darkness and in the end, the hero is redeemed when the monsters (transformation barriers) are vanquished.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Meeting a devil or satan character is a common Archetype explored in dreaming. One can have unconscious associations with the devil because it can represent a type of power within that is unexpressed and appears frightening or disturbing. This power is usually associated with all the wonderful things that were viewed as making us different from others, and were therefore repressed. Resurrecting this part of our natural vitality and power is important in helping us to actualize our destiny.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The devil can wear the mask of the critical tapes of conscience that would prefer we <em>do right</em> and not rock the boat of conformity. Joseph Campbell called this area \"thou shalt\" in his wonderful work on how myths can guide us to actualize our purpose. Like dreaming, the hero undergoing initiation will first discover the clues that will reveal one's true identity. Like any good story, just when it seems the hero is home free, the monster appears to scare the hero back into a fearful world of seeking only acceptance.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">In dreams, we are the hero who must slay the dragon or monsters as the powerful symbols of claiming our rightful power. Dreams are like the mythical tales of mortals who confront frightening giants and beasts to succeed - only by doing so are we worthy of our destiny. By confronting one's deepest fears, we discover the magical elixir that releases us from our shackles and misunderstandings. In fact, it is common when one is going through a type of transformation that includes honesty and self-examination that these type of <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/shadow\"><strong>Shadow</strong></a> dreams come forward. Confronting fear and transforming it into self-actualization is a necessary part of the hero's journey of individuation.

As one of the first places where you developed your social skills, being at a school can be a way of observing the early dynamics behind your interactions with others. The anxiety associated with ‘fitting in’ and ‘being measured’ against others, can make the school the representation of what you feel to be your shortcomings.

The scissors association with the hand can suggests letting go or cutting away the unnecessary so that you can take what you need from life. Cutting tools are used to cut through restraints or to shape something new from the old. Scissors combine the motion of grasping and letting go with the idea of cutting to symbolize ‘cutting away’ the things that bind you. Whatever you are cutting with the scissors is undergoing some type of change just as we prune away branches so new growth can occur.

Since the scorpion is associated with the desert, it can symbolize the 'inner wasteland' that is created by not engaging fully with life. The scorpion resembles a <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/reptiles\"><strong>reptile</strong></a> in that it can have associations with the more autonomous functions of the brain, like fear responses, sex and/or heartbeat regulation, but it is actually a <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/spider\"><strong>spider</strong></a>, bringing forward more of a web weaving tendency or the way you trap yourself in your growth. Its astrological association with the sign Scorpio as an Archetype, brings forward ideas related to the deeper elements of sex and the transformative power of experience.

All creatures associated with the sea generally portray the ‘living side’ or movement of the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/unconscious\"><strong>unconscious</strong></a>. Since ancient times, the fish has been associated with the idea of ‘trapping fate’ or luck. The swimming fish can represent your evolutionary journey, while the dead fish symbolizes your inability to grow. The different types of fish and their <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong>Colors</strong></a> or behavior can shed light on how you are currently ‘connecting’ with information from the unconscious.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">To dream of a <strong><em>crab</em></strong> can suggest moving back and forth indecisively or defensively as you bring emotions forward. This is a highly self-protective creature that can be ‘weighed down’ by its own armor. Dreaming of a crab can be a message about moving beyond insecurity and fear. The <strong><em>dolphin</em></strong> is playful, and could be classified as ‘the dog of the sea.’ Like dogs, who are ‘faithful’ and represent the easy expression of feelings and love in your relationship to others, dreaming of a dolphin suggests this loving connection taking place within you as you move to access your deeper layers.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Jellyfish</em></strong> are not easily seen, and have long tentacles that can sting you. They can portray fear of delving beneath the surface to trace the roots of your feelings that are painful. Their transparent skin associates them with the idea that you may be ‘thin skinned’ in your emotional interactions. The <strong><em>octopus</em></strong> has ‘clinging’ and ‘sucking’ arms that come from every direction and can drown you. It can symbolize clinginess or jealousy and guilt associated with the mother. The <strong><em>seal</em></strong> spends large amounts of time on land and can symbolize making practical use of unconscious information that is rising to the surface. Like the dolphin, they appear to be content with the simple things in life.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Sharks </em></strong>have a way of instilling fear because of their razor sharp teeth. They can represent aggressive behavior that operates unconsciously below the surface, threatening ‘to tear you apart.’ The <strong><em>whale</em></strong> is an enormous fish that is associated with overwhelming urges and grand scale movement within the psyche.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Plant life</em></strong>, which thrive beneath the surface of water and washes ashore when dead, can symbolize what is growing and being nurtured or neglected within you. These <strong><em>seaweeds</em></strong> can also represent how you are letting go. <strong><em>Corals</em></strong> are stony structures, which can threaten ships approaching a harbor and can represent the defensive structures you build to keep others from getting too emotionally close to you. If the coral are colorful and appreciated in the depths of the water, the message is more about the beauty and complexity of your own inner depths.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/seamstress-and-tailor\">Seamstress and Tailor</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1589876518759-5b460cabcc4c?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxTZWFtc3RyZXNzJTIwYW5kJTIwVGFpbG9yfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"silver scissors on pink textile\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@markuswinkler?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Markus Winkler</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The seamstress\n",

Sewing and mending specific pieces of clothing is a way of exploring making changes to the area of life associated with the garment. Shoes and socks represent self-direction; the shirt can represent responsibility, while pants are a symbol of how you provide for yourself.

Misplacing an item reveals your current insecurities surrounding what the symbol represents. If it is a purse or wallet, it can suggest financial insecurities. Looking for an heirloom or family treasure can signify your insecurities about your chance to pro-create. Searching for clothing can symbolize exploring a new identity, while searching for lost baggage can portray the idea that an old identity is no longer serving you. Searching is a theme when you are not acknowledging how you may be feeling unfulfilled in the present.

Disasters associated with the <strong><em><a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/wind\">wind</a>,</em></strong> like <strong><em>tornadoes</em></strong> and <strong><em>hurricanes</em></strong> portray the movement of consciousness, and suggests how the hidden continues to stir within you.

You are released from your controlling and protective tendencies, which can only keep you re-creating the past.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">All symbolism in a dream is important.

You can mend clothing as a way of making your ‘outer covering’ or <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/persona\"><strong>Persona</strong></a> more specific to your unique body or Self. Since clothing represents your Persona or ‘costume’ you wear in public, dreaming of sewing can show how you are working to bring forward a more authentic way of interacting with others.Sewing and mending specific pieces of clothing will portray the area of life associated with the garment. For example, shoes and socks represent self-direction and the path; the shirt can represent responsibility, while pants are a symbol of how you provide for yourself. If a coat or jacket is being mended, you are exploring the 'protective covering' that may be keeping you from full participation with life. Sewing in your dream shows how you are activating some type of change that will allow for easier expression of your full capabilities. Sewing one symbol upon another can also be a message that allows you to explore&nbsp;how these symbols are related or 'tie together.'

As you ‘role play’ by experiencing the different aspects of <em>yourself,</em> it can be portrayed by various characters, where you sometimes behave in a <em>masculine</em> way (mounting/dominating) another masculine character (<em>your aggressive and assertive nature</em>.) You are merely exploring your desire to be more aggressive.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">You may dream of being unusually sensitive or affectionate with another woman, or in a feminine way, as a way of ‘embracing’ or exploring the idea of increased sensitivity within you. The side of you this person represents and how you approach them in the dream, will feel ‘clandestine,’ only in proportion to how you are currently <em>not</em> ‘embracing’ or integrating this side of yourself in waking life.

Since all <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/people\"><strong>characters</strong></a> in a dream represent sides of <em>you</em> and the house represents your paradigm, this type of dream can represent difficult ideas that you are not assimilating or integrating into consciousness. Some side of you simply wants to be acknowledged and let back into 'your house.' It only stalks you because you do not allow it.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>The Shadow </strong>embodies the rejected or repressed aspects of your more natural expression that was sent <em>underground.</em> At some point, you may have decided (or were told) that some part of you was unacceptable because it suggested weakness, fear of fitting in with the group, and can create unresolved anger. In actuality, these aspects become the power of your untapped potential. It appears frightening because you do not understand it.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As a child, you may have been labeled the 'black sheep' or were a caregiver to the caregiver. A difficult relationship with a parent can be at the root of Shadow dreams. One part of you is a pronounced nurturer but you are unable to nurture yourself because of old tapes play that suggest you are not worthy. You grow to become empowered and successful, but the part of you that is <em>disowned</em> (unprocessed) can continue to stalk you. Look at this type of dream as your misunderstood value, which is trying to be understood. Since we role identify with the parent, if we hold them in contempt, there may be an alter identity that is unacknowledged, and yet, stalks us.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Repetitive dreams of this type can be solved by understanding the nature of forgiveness. You may not approve of how you were raised but compassion for another's shortcomings goes along way in helping you to release these unintegrated feelings. Simply denying and repressing it is what causes this 'neglected' Self to stalk you. Any time powerful aspects are not allowed expression, they come forward as something powerful that pursues you. This can happen when you are in a disempowering relationship as an adult. You believe another holds power over you, when you have simply given them this power.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As a type of defense mechanism, Freud believed repression <em>worked to keep the truth inaccessible</em>. He also explored <em>fixation</em> and <em>fetishes </em>as being organized by ideas that evoked a sense of attraction and repulsion at the same time. An urge that initially sought pleasure brought instead, displeasure as the pathway from urge to satisfaction was distorted. Fixation is the way in which we are drawn to the type of situations we would rather avoid. Energy repressed within is always seeking to be understood and integrated.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">This convergence of feeling is at the root of the intense emotional response or <em>charge</em> that is created when you encounter your Shadow in another. Understanding the Shadow is central to your empowerment and wellness. When you can understand and transcend the initial displeasure arising in this type of encounter, you are able to access the truth of what you fail to acknowledge about yourself.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">While Freud hinted at it, Jung pioneered the study of the <em>Shadow </em>and referred to it as the repressed and undeveloped aspects of the personality. Jung described projection as changing “the world into the replica of one’s unknown face. The more projections are thrust between the subject and the environment, the harder it is for the ego to see through its illusions.” He described the Shadow as those dark, unwanted, and unrecognized qualities of the ego that were deemed negative and ultimately repressed.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Understanding the creation, repression and ultimate resurrection of the Shadow through dream characters, provides a basic understanding of <em>why we dream.</em> While you sleep, those sides of you that remain dormant are given expression. All aspects that are unintegrated, and therefore fearful, continue to seek authentic expression. When the dream conjures fear, you can be certain that its symbolism offers clues to your empowerment by integrating the elements associated with the Shadow character.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">In many stories, the hero unmasks the frightening character and discovers an important aspect of themselves. Luke Skywalker removes the mask of Darth Vader to find it is his father. The characters in the Wizard of Oz are all missing something valuable that they need. They uncover how the frightening Wizard of Oz who forces them into life threatening situations, is just a little man standing on a stool orchestrating their fear. You can view frightening characters in dreams in the same way. The nightmare is actually a positive dream of how something powerful is seeking expression. Once you explore what and why they <em>are hiding</em>, you can resurrect something of value. This leads to increased understanding, self acceptance and authentic power.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The fear associated with any character of this type captures the fear of acknowledging your own power or potential in some way.

Shooting can be a representation of the painful emotions that can arise from sexual feelings. You can ‘shoot yourself in the foot’ when you cannot let something go. Knowing you are about to be shot and allowing it to happen is a way of allowing painful feelings to have expression so that you can move beyond them. It is almost as if going through difficulty reaches such as stage that you can no longer ward off the transformation. The ability to accept and become mature is symbolized by accepting the situation or 'biting the bullet.' Seeing another person being shot portrays your denial of a situation that may be 'assassinating' your character. You may be placing the responsibility for what you experience on others, when you must recognize how you are allowing it to happen. The death of characters in a dream often represent the dying away of unproductive tendencies - associated with the character who is killed.

A star is a symbol that can show wishes, aspirations or our desire to be recognized for our accomplishments. A shooting star carries the idea of wishes with something that is burning out. The message can be that we are not taking action steps to go after what we want - instead are allowing events to simply unfold. This type of dream coaches you to examine your aspirations and ensure you are taking steps to manifest them. As a symbol of you, the shooting star can also represent impending burnout.

Some parts grow and fall away, like the skin, teeth, fingernails and hair. They represent growth and where you stand in relationship to your sense of time or the need to let go of the past. Skin represents the most obvious aspect of who you are, and can symbolize the self from a sense of surface awareness, as in ‘only skin deep.’ Focusing on something on the skin can represent an issue that is bugging you. The skin can also symbolize what is blocking your feelings or the need to express yourself. Seeing skin peeling off in a dream can symbolize personal transformation.

    "class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">When evolution led mammals to adapt to a nocturnal existence, olfactory bulbs developed, and smell replaced sight as the dominant sense. These aroma circuits or odor pathways are believed to have become the neural outline of the limbic system within the mammalian area. This is the emotional center that generates the parental care of mammals: playfulness, vocal calling and emotion. Emotion and mood originally evolved from neural structures, once allocated only to the sense of smell that merely attracted or repelled. Over time, these two simple responses became the complicated emotions we experience today.Dreams that focus on an odor may arouse either a positive or negative response. The situation is ‘visible’ only to the nose. ‘Something doesn’t smell right’ when you know it is bad, or ‘the odor may be pleasing’ and attract you when it is good. The other symbolism can shed light on what you are ‘sensing’ with your nose that you are perhaps not able to see. Attempting to cover body odor can signify hiding natural urges or sexuality from others.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/smoke\">Smoke</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1556388275-bb5585725aca?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxTbW9rZXxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"white smoke\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@zhpix?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Pascal Meier</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Smoke can be a ‘smoke screen’ that blocks your ability to see or a warning that something neglected is in peril.

Since ancient times, the snake has personified the need to 'shed the old skin' and transform.

To see one or a few large spiders can represent a larger issue created by getting caught up in a type of web or the dynamics of others. Spider dreams are a call to acknowledge a sense of hiding or entrapment that is stunting you or your ability to be truthfulness, since the spider is symbolizing your behavior too.

Dreams of something cooking on a stove often take place when you are exploring childhood feelings and family dynamics to find the recipe for your happiness and current fulfillment.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/stranger\">Stranger</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1605486066632-74ee8fc55b5e?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxTdHJhbmdlcnxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"white and black UNKs coffee store signage\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nguyendhn?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Nguyen Dang Hoang Nhu</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Just as a movie never introduces a character without them having some type of meaning or role to fulfill – just because you would call someone a stranger in a dream – doesn’t mean they are irrelevant.

The dream of rushing to the airport symbolizes changes in aspirations and ambitions and our feelings about achieving those aspirations in terms of life stages. The suitcase and the idea of baggage can portray old ways of being that we might need to discard and how we feel an urgency to carry 'our costume or mask' into every new situation. Not being able to find something related to packing can be a message that you are overly identifying with only one role, when your greater needs might be sacrificed because of it.

Having surgery on a particular area of the body will be how the psyche attempts to 'cut away' feelings or ideas that are not healthy. If you have an abnormal growth that is being cut away - the message is that a past issue has taken on a life of its own and needs to be released. Sometimes it relates to forgiveness.

He used\n",
    "the word <em>synchronicity</em> to describe the process by which we are inspired by these internal cues. Something rising from the unconscious links an outward event that appears <em>coincidental</em> with information that makes that event <em>personally meaningful</em>.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Its meaning is usually thematic in dreams, and as we connect inspiration to an outward event we find <em>active intuition</em> that validates our inner processes. These inner processes also come to validate our <em>pathway.</em> Synchronicity is how the inner world and outer world are tied together ~ how thoughts affect what we experience. An event might be dismissed because the individual is unaware of the symbolism currently manifesting in their dreams. Measuring dreams against outer events, we discover an uncanny correlation on our pathway of <em>transformation.</em></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As an example, we may be going through life in a state of panic and hurrying to appointments, as we travel further from our authentic center. We experience people honking and cutting us off while we are driving. Since we are <em>not</em> in control of where we are going, we may ignore dreams in which we are being driven by someone else, or losing control of our vehicle.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Perhaps we dream of police stopping us, and the next day our wristwatch stops working. The more we rush forward, the more life appears to slow us down. The police in the dream represent a regulating tendency rising from within: <em>slow down.</em> How can we be living our authentic life if we are constantly rushing to meet the future?</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">We may be holding in our anger and when an event happens, we explode and respond with more emotion than the situation warranted. Since we are repressing our feelings, we may dream of a bear or tiger (mammalian/feelings) attacking us as if our emotional outburst came <em>out of nowhere</em>. The next day, we may be drawn consciously to witnessing pure animal aggression or again, experience others attacking us in some way. <em>What happens around us has an uncanny way of reflecting the well being of our inner world. These repressed patterns of thought are usually thematic in dreams.</em></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Something drastic like a car accident or open-heart surgery doesn’t usually occur until the other cues have failed. Only then, are we planted firmly in one place to understand how our life may have become unbalanced or how our heart had become closed. While we were running in circles, lost in the idea of what the future demanded of us, who were we? The <em>one that knows within</em> appears to take an active interest in promoting wholeness and wellness in this life. It promotes balance and demands that we stay connected to life <em>as it unfolds.</em></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Symbolism may first inspire our dreams and during the day, we may experience a synchronistic event where the same idea appears. Alternatively, a symbol in the outer world may appear in our dreams and then reappear the next day, giving it added emphasis. This symbolism may be repeated several times throughout the day or we may dismiss it and fail to see its message altogether. Synchronicity is showing us how profoundly our experience is tied to what is going on <em>in here</em>.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/syringe\">Syringe</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1593491034932-844ab981ed7c?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxTeXJpbmdlfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"orange and white plastic bottle on brown wooden table\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mykjohnson?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Mykenzie Johnson</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">You may dream that someone is trying to inject you with a syringe if you have given this person an unusual amount of power over your feelings.

Just as you are moved by the words of others, in dreams the person sharing information with you can be viewed as another aspect of yourself bringing light to something you may not recognize. When specific words are mentioned in a dream, it is important to write them down. Often there are profound clues about something you are grappling with and the way 'through' the difficulty is often shared in this way. If the dream concentrates on not talking or silence, it can be a message about increasing your ability to listen, or exploring a situation objectively without classifying it in terms of the past.

To dream of a faucet suggests that you are exploring how to turn emotions either on or off. In a new relationship, you may be trying to overcome feelings of jealousy and possessiveness, or are being forced to subdue your real feelings. A situation may be forcing you to control your emotions and the issues surrounding the faucet will describe whether this is healthy. Chances are, if you are dreaming of a faucet. a new situation is breaking down your defenses so your real feelings can flow.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/tapestry\">Tapestry</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1581964974650-250c3983a17b?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxUYXBlc3RyeXxlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"orange blue and yellow abstract painting\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@steve_j?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Steve Johnson</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Observing the intricacy of a woven fabric can portray your sense of exploring how things are connected.

Just as you lose your baby teeth as a child, wisdom teeth as an adolescent and perhaps all of your teeth when you are old, teeth are associated with letting go of old ways of ‘chewing on things.’ The way that you approached situations in the past will no longer do. Teeth can also represent credibility. As you smile, you may suddenly look stupid because your teeth are missing. This demonstrates how losing teeth can be an aspect of the Trickster, or transformative power, humorously tricking you toward authentic behavior. About to say ‘the same old thing,’ you can only mumble because your mouth is suddenly full of your own teeth. Whatever you were about to say would not be considered the truth. Teeth can also be associated with <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/animals\"><strong>Animals,</strong></a> and can portray natural feelings of sex and passion that need to be brought to the surface.

On one hand, you may dream of returning to school if your current situation poses a challenge that needs to be solved. The message would be to remember that life is a learning experience and that you are still growing. You may have shut down the idea of growth and learning in some way - holding to rigid thinking. Taking a test can symbolize a sense of feeling tested currently.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Taking a quiz or exam in a dream can be a type of initiation to examine whether your beliefs are serving you in a productive way. If you are late for the test and therefore fail, your own insecurities are undermining your ability for success. A person doesn't succeed in life if they believe they will fail. Failure is a prerequisite for success. All accomplishments are achieved after a series of trials that include missing the mark. If you have suddenly forgotten what the material is about, you are being given the opportunity to let your old way of thinking go.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Being quizzed by an unusual character can also be the activation of the <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/trickster\"><strong>Trickster</strong></a> archetype. You are tripped up in your inconsistencies of thought, so that you can start with a fresh perspective. The quiz measures what you know - and sometimes it is better not to know so that you can discover.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams of tests and exams often remind you that life cannot be learned through answers but through experience. Your thought patterns may have become a card catalogue file over time - these types of anxiety dreams are helping you to loosen rigid thinking so that you can grow and continue to be fulfilled. If you are supposed to be in a class and cannot find it, or are late, you may feel insecure about where you are in terms of life stages. The idea that you should be in class underscores learning - perhaps you are dismissing a situation that is meant to teach you something.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/text\">Text</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1572375992501-4b0892d50c69?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxUZXh0fGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"poster lot\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@muratodr?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Murat Onder</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Messages that come over the phone are a symbol of how various aspects of the psyche seek to communicate with you.

Finally, seeing the throat cut in a way that a head topples, shows the release of outworn ideas associated with the person who's head comes off.

Something occurring in daytime suggests ideas already in consciousness. A dream occurring in the night is exploring ideas not yet in consciousness. You may require a light to bring what is in the dark (hidden/unrecognized) into the ‘light’ of consciousness.. Morning can suggest a rebirth or embarking in a new direction. Noon has associations with midlife and turning points. Evening can show the end of difficulty or the sense that a chapter is ending. You can understand the hours as a snapshot of life stages. Being late can represent feeling that you are ‘running behind’ in what you thought you might achieve at this point in your life.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/tipping\">Tipping</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1477003580086-917054ea8418?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxUaXBwaW5nfGVufDB8MHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"yellow kettle on gray wooden table\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@mparzuchowski?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Michał Parzuchowski</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">To dream of something described as tipping shows an imbalance that is not natural.

Inspecting tires on a car can symbolize making changes in a career, while a flat tire can suggest insecurities about your ability to succeed. You may not feel the inspiration or competence necessary to make the transition. The roundness of this symbol has associations with harmony and balance. Used as a symbol of motivation, it can also tie in the idea of being tired or unfulfilled. Tires separate us from feeling the effects of the road we travel, and can personify feeling disconnected from what you are doing or where you are going. If the tires are unusual in some way, explore whether there may be a message or clue about how you can feel successful and fulfilled by doing something different.

When you reveal your intimate side in a situation, you may find your dreams taking place in the bathroom. Of all the rooms you dream about, the bathroom shows your desire to see yourself honestly, without the need to cover up your feelings. During difficult transitions, the bathroom often becomes a symbol of the need to 'get naked' or face the truth. Sometimes urinating when the walls are missing, coincides with entering social situations where you felt forced to reveal yourself to others. The toilet is often a symbol of the release of emotions. Searching for somewhere 'to relieve yourself' can show holding onto feelings or the desire to be more free in your expression.

Cutting tools symbolize cutting through restraints or to shape something new from the old. Scissors combine the motion of grasping and letting go with the idea of cutting to symbolize ‘cutting away’ what binds you. The hammer allows you to ‘nail something’ of get it right, while you may also be pounding out your frustration. A sword can be sexual, although a sword or knife can suggest defensive tendencies or cutting through illusion to see the truth. A fork can represent the ability to gain fulfillment, but can also suggest a ‘fork in the road’ or choice. Artistic tools are associated with creativity and any item that is held in the hand will have an association with self-creation.

Jumping in and out of trains can symbolize how you are trying to find your own way. The train station is a place of transition and has a specific schedule, portraying your feelings about your ability to meet your own expectations.

Two can represent choices and balance, although the idea of Three sides often signifies an imbalance that needs to be resolved. The triangle or the theme of three is also common in spiritual ideas as the direct awareness of the trinity, where body, mind and spirit thrive in harmony.

The psyche has an amazing and clever way of injecting humor into dream symbolism in an effort to jar the status quo. You will know the Trickster because this character is odd and pesters you in a way that demands your attention. Trickster is like a Freudian slip and traps us in our inconsistencies. The part the Trickster character plays in the psyche is to use humor to trick us into being honest with ourselves.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">This humorous character straddles the same psychic trading post where inspiration is packaged and sold as spirituality. Manifesting in many forms, he stands at the psychic crossroad, pointing like the scarecrow in the Wizard of Oz. His antics reveal the ridiculous way that you believe you must make choices. There are many roads and the right road is sometimes just the pathway exposing the contradiction inherent in absolutes. In the middle road between good and evil is your willingness jump into the unknown.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The Trickster offers a puzzle and asks you to dance awhile with ambiguity, so life’s deeper mysteries can be revealed. Portrayed in a Freudian slip, it is Trickster who plants the whoopee cushion in the psyche, triggering laughter when you know that the time is not appropriate. Humor often arises when you perceive an incongruity. Cloaked as the Fool or Vagabond, he points to the middle way between absolutes and the conflicting ideas that have stunted your evolution.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The Raven, Crow or Coyote appear in myths/dreams asking the hero to sacrifice the body in return for metamorphosis. Often presenting you with a wild card of possibilities, the Trickster of the psyche is not afraid to send you out with mismatched shoes during an important presentation when you are in the ‘wrong place.’ Teaching a lesson of humility, you find this Jester of the inner landscape, making you laugh at yourself in all of your serious attempts to be certain.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Trickster represents the power of humor that allows you to see your inner contradictions. Instead of finding your<em> ‘home in the absolute,’</em> you are forced out like a hobo in search of a train. Humiliated and riding in a boxcar, you encounter everything you believed you’d never see. You have no choice but to shake your head and laugh when the rug is pulled out from beneath your interior house of cards. <em>“Oh my, is this what life feels like down here in the gutter? I can’t tell you why, but I suddenly feel alive again.”</em></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Trickster inspires the late night comedian who says what nobody else would dare say. He makes you blurt out the comical truth when in all gravity, you have found yourself trapped in your illogical ideas. Trickster inspires dreams of going to school in your underwear, when what you most want is to abide by the golden rule. It is Trickster who removes the bathroom walls, in dreams where you have no choice but to ‘relieve yourself’ in public. “Let go…be intimate…find your human side and live.” He is the breath of fresh air found at the top of the mountain or sometimes, face down in a puddle, in your migratory journey across the psychic landscape.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">In myths, what Trickster does is always the opposite of what is considered\n",
    "sacred. Like the process of dreaming, Trickster leads you through stages in mysterious steps to ‘trick’ you into growth. We see this in American Indian stories that are humorously interwoven with bits and pieces of truth and insight. In the same way, dreams offer a <em>non-rational</em> way of perceiving experience, beyond the defense mechanisms created by rote and reason. Trickster keeps you from taking yourself too seriously. As a powerful and transformative aspect of the psyche that uses humor to overthrow limitation, when a character appears that that makes you feel uncomfortable, you meet the great shape shifter Trickster.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/truck\">Truck</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501700493788-fa1a4fc9fe62?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxUcnVja3xlbnwwfDB8fA&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"truck on highway during daytime\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rhysatwork?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Rhys Moult</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The truck symbolizes motivation and your desire to move forward.

Between consciousness and the sleep state is an area that allows the imagination to wander. As your level of awareness decreases, you lose your sense of self. You may revisit the past, or explore the future, and in doing so, approach the border of the dreamscape. All the while, consciousness keeps pulling you back into the present.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>Lucid Dreams</strong></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Lucid dreams occur when you ‘wake up’ while dreaming. Sometimes this sudden sense of knowing you are dreaming allows you to do fantastic things like fly over the houses you see. Many people actually wake themselves up within the dream to remain in this lucid state to explore how they can influence dreams. This ability to achieve the lucid dream state is an important initiation into mastering the power of thought and its ability to influence events.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>Nightmares</strong></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The nightmare is actually a good dream that shows something powerful stirring within you. When we are faced with conflict and opposing the necessary change, our dreams can appear more conflicted as we work through it. The more we ignore the need for change, the more our dreams get louder in an effort to 'wake us up' to a necessary transformation. The nightmare often causes you to wake up in a state of panic with your heart racing. Not wanting to go back to sleep, the memory of the dream appears all too real. Sometimes a dream can reflect actual trauma or an unresolved crisis, although the nightmare is always a WAKE UP CALL to learn to let go. Whether you are attempting to overcome a real life crisis, or to transcend non-rational fear, dreaming is a ‘safe place’ that allows these difficult ideas to be explored. Perhaps you cannot recognize that ‘you are on the wrong path,’ and so, the nightmare may recur until the situation is resolved. The nightmare is actually a sign that something powerful has begun to stir within you. See the</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A nightmare can be as simple as ‘leaving something behind’ while you hurry to your destination. It can be as frightening as actually experiencing death or dismemberment as you awaken to the idea of letting go. More than any other dream, the nightmare will disturb you so profoundly, that it cannot be forgotten. It is a natural mechanism, which forces you to confront the truth about how you are hiding from life. Once these fearful feelings are transformed into authentic power, the nightmare will not recur.

Sometimes they leave you feeling puzzled because they seem irrational. Dreams ever seek to wake you to what you are not facing and the hero's journey of wellness through the dreamscape is explored in The Mythology of Sleep: The Waking Power of Dreams. Dreams have a way of forcing consciousness into perplexity, as an important aspect of transformation. At times, a recurring dream can be extremely frightening. Since dreams are suggesting what you fail to acknowledge in daily life, whatever you are avoiding or not facing will continue to be the subject matter of your dream, until it is resolved. Like nightmares, once the puzzle is solved and the aspect is integrated into consciousness, the dream will not recur. Even the most frightening dreams are meant to awaken you to your real nature.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>Dreams About Healing</strong></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Many times vehicle doors, or lower and upper rooms of a house will depict aspects of the body, offering a message about your health and well-being. The front door can suggest arms, while the back doors can represent legs. Lighting or electrical circuitry can be neurological, while water problems can suggest psychological, vascular or ‘plumbing’ issues. The top floor of a building can represent the head, while the rooms below can suggest various parts of the lower body.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Protecting a ‘treasure’ can signify repression at the root of illness, while searching for a key is often the clue to wellness. If you are experiencing ‘dis-ease’, where it is taking place in the body is as important as why. If the left leg is suffering, look for its representation in dreams of ground floor doors, or lower left portion of a structure or vehicle. Sometimes before a physical manifestation will appear, you are warned in advance of over indulgence or things that can impact your wellness. Many therapists recognize repression at the root of illness. Since dreams portray what you are repressing, they are a profound tool in achieving wellness and balance.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>Prophetic Dreams</strong></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The ‘dream cycle’ is a lot like ‘myth cycles.’ In our ancient stories, the hero is tested in exotic landscapes, finding clues in fantastic places. The adventure allows them to uncover the truth about both, their identity and destiny. Similarly, the changing landscape and clues within a dream cycle captures the essence of why we dream. When a dream is observed to ‘morph’ into different landscapes, the dream is described: ‘it seemed like the same dream, but then\n",
    "it changed…’</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">The dream cycle usually presents the idea of transformation in three stages:<br>a) The first shows you as ‘the hero’ facing a current life challenge.<br>b) The second shows the past and the part it played in creating this condition.<br>c) Finally, you are given a bizarre clue as to how you can transform to meet the future. This portion has unusual images that will allow you to discover your real identity and therefore, your destiny.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">In the first portion, you explore the conflict at hand and are given the symbolism that can help you understand it objectively. The second landscape usually portrays family members and symbolism from the past, describing how the current crisis was created. The third portion of the dream is usually the most bizarre, as the transforming aspect of the psyche pushes you beyond your static sense of self. This portion can be prophetic or when compared against future events, will portray actual information that can be validated.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Dreams can be called The Mind’s Mirror because they have a special predisposition for reflecting aspects of you in a way that is puzzling or strange. The ‘newness’ or bizarre imagery of the dreamscape provides the innovative perspective that is necessary to achieve transformation. The third portion of the dream offers information about the ‘missing link’ in overcoming conflict or crisis.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Understanding your dreams will make more sense to you when once you recognize how dreams have an uncanny way of breaking through the walls of consciousness. The synchronistic aspect of the final setting may simply be the result of how your unconscious mind knows what is coming, before you consciously piece the information together.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong>Life Changing Dreams</strong></p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">During periods when you are actively undergoing transformation, you will experience Great Dreams or Cosmic Dreams, which are rich in mythological associations. They often portray a meeting with universal archetypes such as The Great Mother or Wise Man. These dreams affect you with such emotion and appear so vivid that you remember them for years.

As you come to understand ‘the idea of who you should be,’ those elements that are ‘unacceptable’ or denied can remain within an area that is called the unconscious. As these feelings and ideas seek expression, the subconscious net blocks them in daily life. While you sleep, this barrier dissolves and information rises freely into the mind for exploration. Often the symbol representing what is happening or emerging from the unconscious will be the sea or bodies of water.

Clothing can represent the attitude or the Persona, which becomes the mask you wear to fit in. Uniforms can symbolize characteristics associated with the type of uniform, such as police or the patrolling side of psyche, or fire, representing ‘danger’ or how you subdue your feelings. Drum major and other band costumes can be sexual or spiritual. Musical instruments often signify the free expression of emotion or passion. A work uniform that is unfamiliar can be suggesting that you have embarked in a direction of work that may not be fulfilling.

Cutting tools are used to cut through restraints or to shape something new from the old. Scissors combine the motion of grasping and letting go with the idea of cutting to symbolize ‘cutting away’ what binds you. The hammer allows you to ‘nail something’ of get it right, while you may also be pounding out your frustration. A sword can be sexual, although a sword or knife can suggest defensive tendencies or cutting through illusion to see the truth. Artistic tools are associated with creativity and any item that is held in the hand will have an association with self-creation. A pen and pencil carry the idea of communication, while the pen can signify words that are not easily ‘erased.’ The pencil may be portraying words that have no commitment behind them.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Kitchen utensils are associated with changes you are making. You use them to take what you need in order to find nourishment and self worth. Like food, the symbolism is exploring fulfillment. The difference between a fork and a spoon is their shape. A spoon suggests what you need to hold onto in order to feel satisfied, while the fork is more symbolic of taking a stab at something, or making a change in direction that will help you provide for yourself. The fork can also symbolize choices or a crossroad, as in a 'fork in the road.' The knife can symbolize ideas that are painful or the cutting away to get at the truth. A spatula is associated with turning something over or seeing another side of the situation.<br></p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div></div></div></div>\n",

These types of dreams suggest the condition in which you are currently <em>moving forward</em>. The type of vehicle, and whether or not you <em>are driving,</em> <em>in control </em>or <em>being driven</em>, will portray your present sense of direction and autonomy.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Boats, buses </em></strong>and <strong><em>trains</em></strong>, in which you are a ‘passenger,’ suggest how you are following a course that is not self-directed and not easily changed. <strong><em>Travel over water </em></strong>is indicative of emotions and how the ‘flow of events’ or ‘current’ is leading you forward into the future, and often represent the internal drama of uncertainty. The water can be <strong><em>dark, calm </em>or<em> choppy </em></strong>in relation to how you feel about where you are currently going in life. The <strong><em>train</em></strong>follows a proven track as a representation of how the course has been laid down for you. The train can symbolize other's expectations and not necessarily your own. Missing a train can symbolize fears of failing in the eyes of what is expected of you. Jumping in and out of trains can symbolize how you are trying to find <em>your own </em>way. If you dream of a <strong><em>box car on a train</em></strong>, the dream is exploring the idea of other's expectations and the baggage you carry because of it. The <strong><em>bus</em></strong>is a classic image of conformity where a <strong><em>school bus </em></strong>is what you adopted or learned. You will often dream of being on a school bus when you are learning how to assert your uniqueness in relation to conformity. You may move f<strong><em>orward and backward on the bus </em></strong>as a representation of your progress. A <strong><em>public bus </em></strong>shows how you mould your way of being into what you believe is expected of you. It reflects how you may have become a 'passenger' rather than blazing your own path. Since the <strong><em>taxi</em></strong>\n",
    "portrays a ride with usually one other character, the driver should be given consideration as the side of you that is currently <em>driving you forward</em>. <strong><em>Paying a fare </em></strong>for any type of travel shows issues related to self-worth and what you trade in order to move forward in life. <strong><em>Being driven </em></strong>by anyone in a dream portrays a need to become more autonomous.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A <strong><em>bicycle</em></strong>, because it is propelled forward by your actual effort, can suggest vitality and issues related to health. As a child, perhaps you learned to ride by balancing your weight against movement, so it can also suggest balancing well-being with motivation and drive. The bicycle often appears as a representation of following a path that better reflects your <em>natural</em> potential. In a sense, you are slowing down your pace to connect more with experience and get in touch with who you are. <strong><em>Go-carts </em></strong>offer a similar message although they also reveal a sense of competition. <strong><em>Bumper cars </em></strong>and other <strong><em>jalopies</em></strong> suggest how you are moving forward, sometimes in comical or dangerous ways. A vehicle without protection or some of its parts missing can symbolize scarcity or dysfunction operating in your motivation. The <strong><em>motorcycle</em></strong> is also associated with balance and precision. <strong><em>Trucks</em></strong> suggest how you are moving forward while carrying a ‘load’ or attempting to ‘transport’ what is important to you, rather than being free to move forward. <strong><em>Moving vans </em></strong>take carrying unnecessary baggage to a higher level of awareness. They usually appear when you are sorting through old ideas and making changes in preparation for moving forward. Where the bus shows conformity and social demands, the van full of people can represent the various sides of you collectively.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\"><strong><em>Airports</em></strong> and <strong><em>train stations </em></strong>are places of transition, and therefore are associated with hopes and ambitions. You can ‘<strong><em>fly</em></strong>’ to your destination through expanded awareness and insight, or find your <strong><em>compartment</em></strong> or ‘place’ on a train that follows a ‘proven track’ as in expectations. You can be going <strong><em>up, down </em></strong>or in <strong><em>circles</em></strong>, as a way of following inspiration, overcoming repression, or revisiting the past. <strong><em>Danger</em></strong> and the idea of <strong><em>crashing</em></strong> suggest how you are not in control of where you are going and are therefore, feeling uncertain about your direction. Being <strong><em>stopped by police </em></strong>or <strong><em>traffic lights</em></strong> show how you are obeying the disciplinarian controls of conscience.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A <strong><em>delivery truck </em></strong>can signify being given or receiving some type of insight that you may be missing. The package can provide clues to what is hidden. <strong><em>Hitchhiking</em></strong> can represent not taking responsibility for where you are going in life. <strong><em>Giving a ride to an unknown passenger </em></strong>can represent integrating or understanding an unknown part of you at work as the root of your motivation. A <strong><em>parking garage </em></strong>or seeing a <strong><em>parked car </em></strong>reflects how your motivation is currently parked, sometimes because of changes you are making, and at other times, because you might not recognize how and why you undermine your ambition. <strong><em>Fender benders in a parking</em></strong> garage are usually the result of colliding sides of you coming out for consideration. A <strong><em>race car </em></strong>or <strong><em>red sports </em></strong>car can symbolize a competitive streak in your motivation. See <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/colors\"><strong><em>Color</em></strong></a> for other associations of aspects related to motivation.</p></div></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/victim\">Victim</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1538043224072-a1cb7a1122f4?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxWaWN0aW18ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"man lying on bed talking to doctor\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@ayahya09?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Ali Yahya</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Since all people in a dream represent aspects of you, the idea of being a victim portrays a lack of integration or acceptance in some way.

Like the dream of winning a <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/prize\"><strong>prize</strong></a>, you are exploring how you go about seeking fulfillment. Since we dream about what we are not recognizing, you may be overly focused on a sense of competition and are not really enjoying the result of your efforts. At the same time, the dream can be suggesting what it would take to feel more fulfilled. The strange symbols that appear in relation to the dream of winning should be explored as a clue to how you might approach success differently to achieve greater satisfaction. For example, clothing can suggest changes to the core identity. Strange or missing shoes can symbolize changes to the steps you are taking, the need to get grounded or earthy and your relationship to the path. The hair can symbolize a change in ideas. The characters you compete with or who may block your ability to succeed can represent undermining thoughts or actions - or the need to slow down and give consideration to an important aspect within you that may be ignored.

To dream of doing work that is not what you are currently doing, suggests ‘working on’ whatever the symbolism relates to, ie: clothing-persona, warehouse-sorting through old ideas, car-motivation, train-the tracks you feel have been laid for you, or water issues-emotions. Dreaming of serving or eating food at work can represent self-nourishing thoughts that may or may not be working for you. Food is usually a theme when you are seeking more fulfillment in your work by activating passion.

Yet, because worms re-stabilize the soil, bringing it nourishment, dreaming of worms can also symbolize a type of rebirth. Caterpillars have a similar meaning since they transform into butterflies. To dream of maggots can represent how you know a situation has reached a point of decay and needs to transform. These types of creatures are capturing the feelings of insecurity you may feel. The initial feeling of displeasure associated with insignificance usually manifests when you are moving toward self-acceptance. Now that your feelings are out in the open - you can transform.

A woman who observes a wounded man can be exploring insecurities about being able to provide for herself. A man who sees a wounded woman may have shut down his ability to feel because of prior hurts. Where the wound appears on the body can also have significance. On the legs or feet, the message may be about the ability to move forward and feel empowered. Wounds on the arms or hands would symbolize the ability to take what one needs. A scar on the abdomen can represent not being able 'to stomach' difficulty. Wounds on the head can represent ideas that are self limiting or the need to let old grievances go so that one can 'heal.'

It may be that a negative outlook is undermining your success. To dream of a wreck on the road up ahead can symbolize the knowledge of unconscious tendencies (like addiction) that you know are not good for you. If the police direct you to take another route- some aspect of your conscience is warning you. Stopping just before you wreck your car can be a message about changing your behavior.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">As you grow, you can feel insecure about where you are going. In fact, you go through many changes because situations <em>force</em> you to change. The accident or wreck is a way of exploring insecurities about <em>how</em> you are moving forward. The details surrounding the accident will reflect whether or not you feel in control and autonomous in moving forward.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">It is important to note that the accident dream is not always a warning of being on the wrong path. The mishap merely reflects the colliding aspects of where you are in life, and where you feel you should be. Accidents can symbolize your fears as you confront or collide with your other needs. Ambition can be thwarted by fear, or the need to make changes can collide with the feeling of being stuck.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Since a boat relies on the current, wind and outside elements to go forward, accidents involving water suggest the way emotions are driving you. Water accidents can portray fears about how circumstances feel beyond your control and are leading you forward. Choppy water can be a message about feelings you are not confronting that would better serve you if you approached how you feel honestly. Calm water can portray the ways you attempt to go with the flow to master your forward movement.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Accidents involving motorized vehicles represent insecurities about your motivation and ambition. If the accident involves a car, it portrays insecurities about the choices you are making. If the accident involves a plane, you may feel insecure about aspirations as you embark in an upward direction. An accident by train can show the disappointment you feel in light of other's expectations of you. Tracks have been laid down for you, although you have a sense of not being able to follow them.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">If you are driving or are responsible for the accident, you may be questioning your direction, but still feel autonomous and empowered. If someone else is driving or has caused you to be in an accident, this other <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/people\"><strong>'character'</strong></a> should be considered in relation to their influence on your autonomy. This dream shows the power you give away and the key to how it holds you back.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">Example: a mate driving you in a dream reveals the power <em>you have given</em> this person to make decisions for you. A parent driving you, shows the power they hold over you <em>because you allow it. </em>Whomever drives you in a dream holds the key to what drives you in life. If the character is not involved in your life, then consider what part of you they might represent and how this aspect may be undermining your ability to move forward. Accident dreams usually occur when you are attempting to become more empowered, self-actualized and self-directed.</p><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">If\n",
    "the accident involves natural events or is the result of a natural disaster, it can be a way of dissolving your current foundation or belief structure to allow for more ‘natural’ changes within you.

A ‘wrinkle in the fabric’ can suggest difficulty or that something is amiss that you are not admitting. To see laundry or clothes that are wrinkled can represent an identity that is outworn or needs to be abandoned.

If it is a shirt it can represent how others see you; pants relate to responsibilities or how you provide for yourself, while undergarments can have associations with your more intimate nature.

If something frightening is happening on the yacht – we may be pursuing riches or success at the expense of our more basic needs.

We dream of what we are not facing and the zombie can represent a lifeless approach that is uninspired or without vision. While we may feel victimized by events - it can be our 'negativism' that undermines our success. Zombies can also suggest materialism over passion, or vampirism where one side of the self succeeds at the expense of another.The <strong>Zombie Apocalpyse </strong>dream shows the movement of the psyche&nbsp;toward rebirth after overcoming what may have felt like a negative period. In most myths, or the inspiration of the collective unconscious ie: archetypes, the apocalypse is usually followed by a rebirth for civilization. The landscape in a dream shows the current climate of the inner landscape. If the 'world' is ending then an old&nbsp;way of thinking may be passing. If it is ending with a theme of Zombies, the message can be that a rebirth will lead to optimism&nbsp;and a more fulfilling way of interacting with life. <a class=\"serializers-module--link--NkDMM\" href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/nightmare\"><strong>Nightmares</strong></a>are a positive sign&nbsp;that something is&nbsp;shifting or coming into consciousness for examination and release.</p></div></section></div><a class=\"dream-dictionary-module--topLink--9VuUh\" href=\"#\">Back to top</a></div><div><h3><a href=\"/oracles/dream-dictionary/zoo\">Zoo</a></h3><div><div><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1534567153574-2b12153a87f0?crop=entropy&amp;cs=srgb&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxNjk0NTl8MHwxfHNlYXJjaHwxfHxab298ZW58MHwwfHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=85&amp;w=800\" alt=\"two giraffe and three zebra on green grass field under trees at daytime\" style=\"width: 100%;\"></div><figcaption class=\"layout-module--caption--n8RoN\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@nxn?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Nikolay Tchaouchev</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=Cafe%20au%20Soul&amp;utm_medium=referral\">Unsplash</a></figcaption><section class=\"section-module--root--jRTGT white section-module--noPadding---U+0z\"><div class=\"container-module--root--JHM7J\"><p class=\"typography-module--paragraph---kHwl\">A zoo is a landscape where you explore your passions and earthy drives aside from social conditioning. Since this is a place of exotic animals that are kept in cages, dreaming of a zoo can represent how you are ‘visiting’ the idea of natural expression, but are not expressing your urges. When an animal gets loose from a cage, this part of you is breaking free. Look up the various animals for more clues to the side of you undergoing exploration.
